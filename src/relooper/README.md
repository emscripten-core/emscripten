Relooper
========

This is an optimized C++ implemention of the Relooper algorithm originally developed as part
of Emscripten. This implementation includes optimizations added since the original academic
paper [1] - see paper.pdf - was published about it, and is written in an LLVM-friendly way
with the goal of inclusion in upstream LLVM.
