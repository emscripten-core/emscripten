This folder contains the musl version of libc at `/musl`. The upstream version
can be found at http://www.musl-libc.org/.

Most of the source comes from musl v1.2.5, with some exceptions listed below.
We track these changes from upstream in https://github.com/emscripten-core/musl
and use a script (`system/lib/update_musl.py`) to pull in updates.

Some changes have been made to the version that was taken from upstream, including:

 * Emscripten-specific changes (from before this readme existed). These should be marked with `XXX EMSCRIPTEN` in the source, or ifdefed with `#if __EMSCRIPTEN__`. They are mostly in pthreads code and hopefully temporary.
 * Backporting an operator-precedence warning fix from 6e76e1540fc58a418494bf5eb832b556f9c5763e in the upstream version.
 * Switch to using the wasi `fd_write` syscall instead of `writev`.
 * Simplify stdout stream handling: do not support seeking, terminal handling, etc., as it just increases code size and Emscripten doesn't have those features anyhow.
 * Setting `_POSIX_REALTIME_SIGNALS` and `_POSIX_SPAWN` macros to -1, to exclude unsupported functions.

Copy log.c and log2.c from earlier version of musl which result in smaller
binary size since they do not rely data tables in log_data.c and log2_data.c.
