:: Python Windows bug https://bugs.python.org/issue34780: If this script was invoked via a
:: shared stdin handle from the parent process, and that parent process stdin handle is in
:: a certain state, running python.exe might hang here. To work around this, if
:: EM_WORKAROUND_PYTHON_BUG_34780 is defined, invoke python with '< NUL' stdin to avoid
:: sharing the parent's stdin handle to it, avoiding the hang.

:: On Windows 7, the compiler batch scripts are observed to exit with a non-zero errorlevel,
:: even when the python executable above did succeed and quit with errorlevel 0 above.
:: On Windows 8 and newer, this issue has not been observed. It is possible that this
:: issue is related to the above python bug, but this has not been conclusively confirmed,
:: so using a separate env. var EM_WORKAROUND_WIN7_BAD_ERRORLEVEL_BUG to enable the known
:: workaround this issue, which is to explicitly quit the calling process with the previous
:: errorlevel from the above command.

:: Also must use goto to jump to the command dispatch, since we cannot invoke emcc from
:: inside a if() block, because if a cmdline param would contain a char '(' or ')', that
:: would throw off the parsing of the cmdline arg.
