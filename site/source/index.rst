.. Emscripten documentation master file, created by
   sphinx-quickstart on Tue Jul 01 09:20:29 2014.
   You can adapt this file completely to your liking, but it should at least
   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. warning:: This site is still under construction. We've imported many of the topics from the `wiki <https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/wiki>`_, but many have still not been checked and are subject to change. What is great though, is that we've already create a lot of :doc:`/docs/api_reference/index` and cross-linked it in the imported pages. Over the next few days wiki pages that have been imported will be deleted from the wiki, and this document will become the "master copy".
