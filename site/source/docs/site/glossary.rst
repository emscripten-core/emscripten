  XHR
    Contraction of ``XMLHttpRequest``. Emscripten uses XHRs for asynchronously downloading binary data.

  LLVM backend
    A (*Clang*) compiler backend that converts the :term:`LLVM` Intermediate Representation (IR) to code for a specified machine or other languages. In the case of Emscripten, the specified target is JavaScript.

  Minifying
    `Minification <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minification_(programming)>`_ in JavaScript is the process of removing all unnecessary characters from source code without changing its functionality. At higher optimisation levels Emscripten uses the :term:`Closure Compiler` to minify Emscripten code.

  Relooping
    Recreate high-level loop and ``if`` structures from the low-level labels and branches that appear in LLVM assembly (definition taken from `this paper <https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/main/docs/paper.pdf?raw=true>`_).

  SDL
    `Simple DirectMedia Layer <https://www.libsdl.org/>`_ (SDL) is a cross-platform development library designed to provide low level access to audio, keyboard, mouse, joystick, and graphics hardware via OpenGL and Direct3D.

    The original compiler supported a number of other memory models and compilation modes (see `Code Generation Modes <https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/wiki/Code-Generation-Modes>`_) but *Typed Arrays Mode 2* proved to have, among other benefits, the greatest support for arbitrary code.


  Load-store consistency
    Load-Store Consistency (LSC), is the requirement that after a value with a specific type is written to a memory location, loads from that memory location will be of the same type. So if a variable contains a 32-bit floating point number, then both loads and stores to that variable will be of 32-bit floating point values, and not 16-bit unsigned integers or anything else.

    .. note:: This definition is taken from `Emscripten: An LLVM-to-JavaScript Compiler <https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/main/docs/paper.pdf?raw=true>`_ (section 2.1.1). There is additional detail in that paper.


Emscripten tools and dependencies
=================================

.. glossary::
  :sorted:

  Clang
    Clang is a compiler front end for C, C++, and other programming languages that uses :term:`LLVM` as its back end.

  emcc
    The :ref:`emccdoc`. Emscripten's drop-in replacement for a compiler like *gcc*.

  Emscripten Command Prompt
    The :ref:`emcmdprompt` is used to call Emscripten tools from the command line on Windows.

  Compiler Configuration File
    The :ref:`Compiler Configuration File <compiler-configuration-file>` stores the :term:`active <Active Tool/SDK>` tools and SDKs as defined using :term:`emsdk activate <emsdk>`.

  LLVM
    `LLVM <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LLVM>`_ is a compiler infrastructure designed to allow optimization of programs written in arbitrary programming languages.

  Fastcomp
    Fastcomp was Emscripten's second compiler core, after the JS compiler and before the new LLVM Wasm backend.

  Binaryen
    `Binaryen <https://github.com/WebAssembly/binaryen/>`_ is a WebAssembly compiler toolkit, which Emscripten uses to modify and optimize Wasm.

  node.js
    `Node.js <https://nodejs.org/en/>`_ is a cross-platform runtime environment for server-side and networking applications written in JavaScript. Essentially it allows you to run JavaScript applications outside of a browser context.

  Python
    Python is a scripting language used to write many of Emscripten's tools. The required version is listed in the :ref:`toolchain requirements <central-list-of-emscripten-tools-and-dependencies>`.

  Java
    `Java <http://www.java.com/en/download/faq/whatis_java.xml>`_ is a programming language and computing platform. It is used by Emscripten for the code that performs some advanced optimisations. The required version is listed in the :ref:`toolchain requirements <central-list-of-emscripten-tools-and-dependencies>`.

  JavaScript
    `JavaScript <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JavaScript>`_ (`ECMAScript <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript>`_) is a programming language that is primarily used as part of a web browser, providing programmatic access to objects within a host environment. With :term:`node.js`, it is also being used in server-side network programming.

    The `asm.js <http://asmjs.org/faq.html>`_ subset of JavaScript is Emscripten's target output language.

  Closure Compiler
    The closure compiler is used to minify Emscripten-generated code at higher optimisations.

  Git
    `Git <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Git_(software)>`_ is a distributed revision control system. Emscripten is hosted on :term:`GitHub` and can be updated and modified using a git client.

  GitHub
    `GitHub <https://github.com/>`_ is a :term:`Git` repository web-based hosting service that also offers project-based collaboration features including wikis, task management, and bug tracking.

    The Emscripten project is hosted on GitHub.

  lli
  LLVM Interpreter
    The `LLVM interpreter (LLI) <http://llvm.org/releases/3.0/docs/CommandGuide/html/lli.html>`_ executes programs from :term:`LLVM` bitcode. This tool is not maintained and has odd errors and crashes.


SDK Terms
=========

The following terms are used when referring to the SDK and :ref:`emsdk`:

.. glossary::

  emsdk
    The :ref:`emsdk` is used to perform all SDK maintenance and can install, update, add, remove and :term:`activate <Active Tool/SDK>` :term:`SDKs <SDK>` and :term:`tools <Tool>`. Most operations are of the form ``./emsdk command``. To access the *emsdk* script, launch the :term:`Emscripten Command Prompt`.

  Tool
    The basic unit of software bundled in the :term:`SDK`. A Tool has a name and a version. For example, **clang-3.2-32bit** is a tool that contains the 32-bit version of the *Clang* v3.2 compiler. Other tools used by *Emscripten* include :term:`Java`, :term:`Git`, :term:`node.js`, etc.

  SDK
    A set of :term:`tools <Tool>`. For example, **sdk-1.5.6-32bit** is an SDK consisting of the tools: clang-3.2-32bit, node-0.10.17-32bit, python-2.7.5.1-32bit and emscripten-1.5.6.

    There are a number of different Emscripten SDK packages. These can be downloaded from :ref:`here <sdk-download-and-install>`.

  Active Tool/SDK
    The :term:`emsdk` can store multiple versions of :term:`tools <Tool>` and
    :term:`SDKs <SDK>`. The active tools/SDK is the set of tools that are used
    by default on the *Emscripten Command Prompt*. This compiler configuration
    is stored in an emsdk-specific config file (**.emscripten**) and can be
    changed using *emsdk*.

  emsdk root directory
    The :term:`emsdk` can manage any number of :term:`tools <Tool>` and :term:`SDKs <SDK>`, and these are stored in :term:`subdirectories <SDK root directory>` of the *emsdk root directory*. The **emsdk root** is the directory specified when you first installed an SDK.

  SDK root directory
    The :term:`emsdk` can store any number of tools and SDKs. The *SDK root directory* is the directory used to store a particular :term:`SDK`. It is located as follows, with respect to the :term:`emsdk root directory`: **<emsdk root>\\emscripten\\<sdk root directory>\\**
