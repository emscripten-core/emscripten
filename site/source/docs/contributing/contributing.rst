Contributing
============

Anyone can contribute to Emscripten â€” if you find it useful and want to help
improve the project, follow the suggestions below.

Feel free to file :ref:`bug reports <bug-reports>`, :ref:`join the discussion
<contact>` and share your own ideas with the community!


Getting started
===============

A good starting point is to work on the `open issues on GitHub
<https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues?state=open>`_. Many issues
can be resolved without an in-depth knowledge of compiler internals, and this is
a great way to learn more about the project.

.. tip:: We really appreciate your help. Every existing issue closed means more
   time for the core contributors to work on new features, optimizations and
   other enhancements.

In addition to improving the toolchain, you can also :ref:`review and update
this documentation <about-this-site-contributing>`.


Next steps
==========

As a new contributor you should read the :ref:`Developer's-Guide`. You may also
need to :ref:`install Emscripten from source <installing-from-source>` and
become familiar with :ref:`Debugging` and :ref:`Building-Projects`.

Please :ref:`get in touch with the community <contact>` to share your ideas and
work out where you can make the most difference.
