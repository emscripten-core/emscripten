Contributing to Emscripten
==========================

This section contains articles that are relevant to anyone who wants to contribute to Emscripten and help improve the project.

- :ref:`contributing` provides an introduction to contributing, along with a few ideas for how you can help.
- The :ref:`Developer's-Guide` contains contributor-relevant information, covering compiler operation and submitting patches to the Emscripten repositories.
- :ref:`emscripten-authors` is a partial list of Emscripten contributors, which used to be updated manually. The git log has the full list of all contributors,
  and for that reason it is not necessary to add to the AUTHORS file manually any more (but it is optional).
