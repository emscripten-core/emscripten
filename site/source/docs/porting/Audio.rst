Emscripten ships with its own implementation of the OpenAL 1.1 API, using the Web Audio API as a backend.

You can reasonably expect ported OpenAL applications to "just work" with no additional effort. Just link with the ``-lopenal`` linker flag.

There are some implementation-specific aspects which are worth considering and are documented here.

.. warning:: There used to be no additional flag to pass to the compiler in order to use OpenAL. However, specifying ``-lopenal`` as mentioned above should be considered mandatory (at some point in the future, it **will** be)!

.. warning:: As Emscripten ships with its own implementation you must not link to any other implementation!

.. _Audio-openal-extensions-g:

Supported OpenAL extensions
===========================

The following extensions are supported by Emscripten's OpenAL implementation.

- ``ALC_SOFT_pause_device``;
- ``ALC_SOFT_HRTF``;
- ``AL_EXT_float32``;
- ``AL_SOFT_loop_points``;
- ``AL_SOFT_source_length``;
- ``AL_EXT_source_distance_model``;
- ``AL_SOFT_source_spatialize``;

.. warning:: This doesn't mean you should just assume their presence ! For correctness, you should **always** check if an extension is supported before using it, like a good application would do.


.. _Audio-guidelines-g:

Guidelines for Audio on Emscripten
==================================

Know that your application needs to yield to the Javascript main loop for audio
processing to take place
(See :ref:`Browser main loop <emscripten-runtime-environment-main-loop>`). Put
simply, this kind of code will block indefinitely:

.. code-block:: c

    while(nframes < THE_NUMBER_OF_FRAMES_WE_WANT)
        alcGetIntegerv(device, ALC_CAPTURE_SAMPLES, 1, &nframes);

The above snippet usually works in native applications because most OpenAL
implementations own and manage one or more separate threads. This is **not** the
case in Emscripten. What you must do instead is perform each such query only
once per "main loop iteration" (i.e the callback you provide via
:c:func:`emscripten_set_main_loop` or :c:func:`emscripten_set_main_loop_arg`).

Another issue you may experience is that browsers will not allow audio to play
before user input. This prevents pages from auto-playing media, which can be
annoying if you didn't want that. Emscripten's OpenAL implementation (and also
SDL1) will automatically listen for a user click or keypress on the document
and the canvas, and resume audio for you. That means that audio should start
to play once the user does something on the page. (See
``autoResumeAudioContext()`` for how this is done internally.)

.. _Audio-openal-capture-behavior-g:

Emscripten-specific capture behavior
====================================

Attempting to open an input stream to the user's audio capture device
results in the asynchronous appearance of a small browser-specific dialog
asking for the user's permission, and on some browsers, the capture device to choose.


With this in mind, when ``alcCaptureOpenDevice()`` is called with valid and
supported parameters, a "proxy" device is returned, which successfully
captures no sample until the user clicks "Allow" on said dialog.

That means, when calling ``alcGetIntegerv(device, ALC_CAPTURE_SAMPLES, 1, &nframes)``, ``nframes`` remains set to zero until the user clicks "Allow". You might want to make your app handle this specific behavior.

If the user clicks "Deny", the device is invalidated (because this is somewhat
similar to unplugging the physical device) and calls to ``alcCapture*`` functions on that
device then consistently fail with ``ALC_INVALID_DEVICE``.
Your application should be prepared to handle this properly.

.. note::
    Some browsers "remember" this choice and apply it automatically every time it would be asked again instead.
    There's no way for the implementation to detect this behavior.


.. _Audio-openal-capture-details-g:

Useful implementation details of OpenAL capture
===============================================

Internally, Web Audio's capture data is always backed by a Javascript ``Float32Array``.
Thus, ``AL_FORMAT_MONO_FLOAT32`` and ``AL_FORMAT_STEREO_FLOAT32`` are the only formats which do not require converting acquired samples from their initial type to another.

Also, the actual sample rate at which samples are acquired from the device is currently dictated by the browser and hardware, instead of user code. If this sample rate does not match the one your app requests, the implementation is required to perform resampling on your behalf.

That sample rate is given by ``audioCtx.sampleRate``, where ``audioCtx`` is the ``AudioContext`` object used internally by the relevant capture ``ALCdevice``.
Currently, Emscripten provides no direct way for applications to access this value, but this might be provided through an Emscripten-specific OpenAL extension (which is not here yet because it requires registration).

Right now though there's a quick and *de facto* reliable way to do this (C example):

.. code-block:: c

    #ifdef __EMSCRIPTEN__

    #include <emscripten.h>

    // Avoid calling this more than once! Caching the value is up to you.
    unsigned query_sample_rate_of_audiocontexts() {
        return EM_ASM_INT({
            var AudioContext = window.AudioContext || window.webkitAudioContext;
            var ctx = new AudioContext();
            var sr = ctx.sampleRate;
            ctx.close();
            return sr;
        });
    }
    #endif

It is reasonable to expect this sample rate to be either 44100Hz or 48000Hz. You can test it right now by copying the javascript part into your browser's console if you're curious.


.. _Audio-improving-g:

Improving and extending the implementation
==========================================

Currently, the OpenAL capture implementation performs na√Øve linear resampling because it is simple and the small loss of quality was deemed acceptable.

However, you're welcome to improve this by contributing if you so wish! See `this issue <https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues/5349>`_ , for instance.

Likewise, if you'd like to see a particular extension implemented (whether it is registered or not), then your best bet is to either file an issue (provided no related prior issue existed for this), or contribute! See :ref:`Contributing <contributing>` for guidelines.
