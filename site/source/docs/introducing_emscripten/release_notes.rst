=============

Changes between tagged Emscripten versions are recorded in the 
`ChangeLog <https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/blob/main/ChangeLog.md>`_
(``ChangeLog.md`` in the source repo).
This log includes high-level information about new features, user-oriented
fixes, options, command-line parameters, usage changes, deprecations,
significant internal modifications, optimizations, etc. The log for each version
links to a detailed diff report, which lists all the incremental changes since
the previous release.
