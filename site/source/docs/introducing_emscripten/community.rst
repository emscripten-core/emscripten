Get in touch
============

The best ways contact the community are:

- The GitHub `Issue Tracker <https://github.com/emscripten-core/emscripten/issues?state=open>`_
- Mailing list: `emscripten-discuss <http://groups.google.com/group/emscripten-discuss>`_
- Real-time chat: `#emscripten on Discord <https://discord.gg/53u3EKq>`_ (there was also an IRC channel on Mozilla IRC, but they are shutting those servers down). We are also open to exploring other options than Discord, if you're interested to help out, let us know!
