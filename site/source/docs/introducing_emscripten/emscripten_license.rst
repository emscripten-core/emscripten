===================
Open Source License
===================

Emscripten is made available under two permissive open source licenses: the *MIT license* and the *University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License*. 

There is little, if any, practical difference between the licenses. They are both offered because the:

- *MIT license* is well known and understood.
- *University of Illinois/NCSA Open Source License* allows Emscripten's code to be integrated upstream into LLVM, should the opportunity arise. 

The license for Emscripten |release| (|today|) is reproduced below. The `current full licence <https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/blob/master/LICENSE>`_ can be found on Github (and is also present in the root of the SDK).
