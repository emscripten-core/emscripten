html5.h
*******

The C++ APIs in html5.h define the Emscripten low-level glue bindings
to interact with HTML5 events from native code.

Tip: The C++ APIs map closely to their *equivalent HTML5 JavaScript
  APIs*. The HTML5 specifications listed below provide additional
  detailed reference "over and above" the information provided in this
  document.In addition, the *Test/Example code* can be reviewed to see
  how the code is used.

The HTML5 specifications for APIs that are mapped by **html5.h**
include:

   * DOM Level 3 Events: Keyboard, Mouse, Mouse Wheel, Resize,
     Scroll, Focus.

   * Device Orientation Events for gyro and accelerometer.

   * Screen Orientation Events for portrait/landscape handling.

   * Fullscreen Events for browser canvas fullscreen modes
     transitioning.

   * Pointer Lock Events for relative-mode mouse motion control.

   * Vibration API for mobile device haptic vibration feedback
     control.

   * Page Visibility Events for power management control.

   * Touch Events.

   * Gamepad API.

   * Beforeunload event.

   * WebGL context events

How to use this API
===================

Most of these APIs use an event-based architecture; functionality is
accessed by registering a callback function that will be called when
the event occurs.

Note: The Gamepad API is currently an exception, as only a polling
  API is available. For some APIs, both an event-based and a polling-
  based model are exposed.


Registration functions
----------------------

The typical format of registration functions is as follows (some
methods may omit various parameters):

      EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT emscripten_set_some_callback(
              const char *target,     // ID of the target HTML element.
              void *userData,         // User-defined data to be passed to the callback.
              EM_BOOL useCapture,     // Whether or not to use capture.
              em_someevent_callback_func callback     // Callback function.
      );

The "target" parameter is the ID of the HTML element to which the
callback registration is to be applied. This field has the following
special meanings:

   * "0" or "NULL": A default element is chosen automatically based
     on the event type, which should be reasonable most of the time.

   * "#window": The event listener is applied to the JavaScript
     "window" object.

   * "#document": The event listener is applied to the JavaScript
     "document" object.

   * "#screen": The event listener is applied to the JavaScript
     "window.screen" object.

   * "#canvas": The event listener is applied to the Emscripten
     default WebGL canvas element.

   * Any other string without a leading hash "#" sign: The event
     listener is applied to the element on the page with the given ID.

The "userData" parameter is a user-defined value that is passed
(unchanged) to the registered event callback. This can be used to, for
example, pass a pointer to a C++ class or similarly to enclose the C
API in a clean object-oriented manner.

The "useCapture" parameter  maps to "useCapture" in
EventTarget.addEventListener. It indicates whether or not to initiate
*capture*: if "true" the callback will be invoked only for the DOM
capture and target phases; if "false" the callback will be triggered
during the target and bubbling phases. See DOM Level 3 Events for a
more detailed explanation.

Most functions return the result using the type "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT".
Non-zero and positive values denote success. Negative values signal
failure. None of the functions fail or abort by throwing a JavaScript
or C++ exception. If a particular browser does not support the given
feature, the value "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED" will be returned
at the time the callback is registered.


Callback functions
------------------

When the event occurs the callback is invoked with the relevant event
"type" (for example "EMSCRIPTEN_EVENT_CLICK"), a "struct" containing
the details of the event that occurred, and the "userData" that was
originally passed to the registration function. The general format of
the callback function is:

   typedef EM_BOOL (*em_someevent_callback_func) // Callback function. Return true if event is "consumed".
           (
           int eventType, // The type of event.
           const EmscriptenSomeEvent *someEvent, // Information about the event.
           void *userData // User data passed from the registration function.
           );

Callback handlers that return an "EM_BOOL" may specify "true" to
signal that the handler *consumed* the event (this suppresses the
default action for that event by calling its ".preventDefault();"
member). Returning "false" indicates that the event was not consumed —
the default browser event action is carried out and the event is
allowed to pass on/bubble up as normal.

Calling a registration function with a "null" pointer for the callback
causes a de-registration of that callback from the given "target"
element. All event handlers are also automatically unregistered when
the C "exit()" function is invoked during the "atexit" handler pass.
Either use the function "emscripten_set_main_loop()" or set
"Module.noExitRuntime = true;" to make sure that leaving "main()" will
not immediately cause an "exit()" and clean up the event handlers.


Functions affected by web security
----------------------------------

Some functions, including "emscripten_request_pointerlock()" and
"emscripten_request_fullscreen()", are affected by web security.

While the functions can be called anywhere, the actual "requests" can
only be raised inside the handler for a user-generated event (for
example a key, mouse or touch press/release).

When porting code, it may be difficult to ensure that the functions
are called inside appropriate event handlers (so that the requests are
raised immediately). As a convenience, developers can set
"deferUntilInEventHandler=true" to automatically defer insecure
requests until the user next presses a keyboard or mouse button. This
simplifies porting, but often results in a poorer user experience. For
example, the user must click once on the canvas to hide the pointer or
transition to full screen.

Where possible, the functions should only be called inside appropriate
event handlers. Setting "deferUntilInEventHandler=false" causes the
functions to abort with an error if the request is refused due to a
security restriction: this is a useful mechanism for discovering
instances where the functions are called outside the handler for a
user-generated event.


Test/Example code
-----------------

The HTML5 test code demonstrates how to use this API:

   * test_html5.c

   * test_html5_fullscreen.c

   * test_html5_mouse.c


General types
=============

EM_BOOL

   This is the Emscripten type for a "bool".

EM_UTF8

   This is the Emscripten type for a UTF8 string (maps to a "char").
   This is used for node names, element ids, etc.


Function result values
======================

Most functions in this API return a result of type
"EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT". None of the functions fail or abort by throwing a
JavaScript or C++ exception. If a particular browser does not support
the given feature, the value "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED" will be
returned at the time the callback is registered.

EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT

   This type is used to return the result of most functions in this
   API.  Positive values denote success, while zero and negative
   values signal failure. Possible values are listed below.

   EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_SUCCESS

      The operation succeeded.

   EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_DEFERRED

      The requested operation cannot be completed now for *web
      security reasons*, and has been deferred for completion in the
      next event handler.

   EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_NOT_SUPPORTED

      The given operation is not supported by this browser or the
      target element.     This value will be returned at the time the
      callback is registered if the operation is not supported.

   EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_FAILED_NOT_DEFERRED

      The requested operation could not be completed now for *web
      security reasons*. It failed because the user requested the
      operation not be deferred.

   EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_INVALID_TARGET

      The operation failed because the specified target element is
      invalid.

   EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_UNKNOWN_TARGET

      The operation failed because the specified target element was
      not found.

   EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_INVALID_PARAM

      The operation failed because an invalid parameter was passed to
      the function.

   EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_FAILED

      Generic failure result message, returned if no specific result
      is available.

   EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_NO_DATA

      The operation failed because no data is currently available.


Keys
====


Defines
-------

EMSCRIPTEN_EVENT_KEYPRESS
EMSCRIPTEN_EVENT_KEYDOWN
EMSCRIPTEN_EVENT_KEYUP

   Emscripten key events.

DOM_KEY_LOCATION

   The location of the key on the keyboard; one of the values below.

   DOM_KEY_LOCATION_STANDARD
   DOM_KEY_LOCATION_LEFT
   DOM_KEY_LOCATION_RIGHT
   DOM_KEY_LOCATION_NUMPAD

      Locations of the key on the keyboard.


Struct
------

EmscriptenKeyboardEvent

   The event structure passed in keyboard events: "keypress",
   "keydown" and "keyup".

   Note that since the DOM Level 3 Events spec is very recent at the
   time of writing (2014-03), uniform support for the different fields
   in the spec is still in flux. Be sure to check the results in
   multiple browsers. See the unmerged pull request #2222 for an
   example of how to interpret the legacy key events.

   EM_UTF8 key

      The printed representation of the pressed key.

      Maximum size 32 "char" (i.e. "EM_UTF8 key[32]").

   EM_UTF8 code

      A string that identifies the physical key being pressed. The
      value is not affected by the current keyboard layout or modifier
      state, so a particular key will always return the same value.

      Maximum size 32 "char" (i.e. "EM_UTF8 code[32]").

   unsigned long location

      Indicates the location of the key on the keyboard. One of the
      "DOM_KEY_LOCATION" values.

   EM_BOOL ctrlKey
   EM_BOOL shiftKey
   EM_BOOL altKey
   EM_BOOL metaKey

      Specifies which modifiers were active during the key event.

   EM_BOOL repeat

      Specifies if this keyboard event represents a repeated press.

   EM_UTF8 locale

      A locale string indicating the configured keyboard locale. This
      may be an empty string if the browser or device doesn't know the
      keyboard's locale.

      Maximum size 32 char (i.e. "EM_UTF8 locale[32]").

   EM_UTF8 charValue

      The following fields are values from previous versions of the
      DOM key events specifications. See the character representation
      of the key. This is the field "char" from the docs, but renamed
      to "charValue" to avoid a C reserved word.

      Maximum size 32 "char" (i.e. "EM_UTF8 charValue[32]").

      Warning: This attribute has been dropped from DOM Level 3
        events.

   unsigned long charCode

      The Unicode reference number of the key; this attribute is used
      only by the keypress event. For keys whose "char" attribute
      contains multiple characters, this is the Unicode value of the
      first character in that attribute.

      Warning: This attribute is deprecated, you should use the
        field "key" instead, if available.

   unsigned long keyCode

      A system and implementation dependent numerical code identifying
      the unmodified value of the pressed key.

      Warning: This attribute is deprecated, you should use the
        field "key" instead, if available.

   unsigned long which

      A system and implementation dependent numeric code identifying
      the unmodified value of the pressed key; this is usually the
      same as "keyCode".

      Warning: This attribute is deprecated, you should use the
        field "key" instead, if available. Note thought that while
        this field is deprecated, the cross-browser support for
        "which" may be better than for the other fields, so
        experimentation is recommended. Read issue
        https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/2817 for more
        information.

Defines
-------

EMSCRIPTEN_EVENT_WHEEL

   Emscripten wheel event.

DOM_DELTA_PIXEL

DOM_DELTA_LINE

   The units of measurement for the delta must be individual lines of
   text (from spec).

DOM_DELTA_PAGE

   The units of measurement for the delta must be pages, either
   defined as a single screen or as a demarcated page (from spec).

      them to integer, or it might result in scroll values of 0. The
      positive Y scroll direction is when scrolling the page downwards
      (page CSS pixel +Y direction), which corresponds to scrolling
      the mouse wheel downwards (away from the screen) on Windows,
      Linux, and also on OSX when the 'natural scroll' option is
      disabled.

     * The DOM3 Events specification only requires that the "Window"
       object sends resize events. It is valid to register a "resize"
       callback on other DOM elements, but the browser is not required
       to fire "resize" events for these.

   Parameters:
      * **target** (*const char**) -- *Target HTML element id*.

      * **userData** (*void**) -- *User-defined data* to be passed
        to the callback (opaque to the API).

      * **useCapture** (*EM_BOOL*) -- Set "true" to *use capture*.

      * **callback** (*em_ui_callback_func*) -- A callback function.
        The function is called with the type of event, information
        about the event, and user data passed from this registration
        function. The callback should return "true" if the event is
        consumed.

Fullscreen
==========


Defines
-------

EMSCRIPTEN_EVENT_FULLSCREENCHANGE

   Emscripten fullscreenchange event.

EMSCRIPTEN_FULLSCREEN_SCALE

   An enum-like type which specifies how the Emscripten runtime should
   treat the CSS size of the target element when displaying it in
   fullscreen mode via calls to functions
   "emscripten_request_fullscreen_strategy()" and
   "emscripten_enter_soft_fullscreen()".

EMSCRIPTEN_FULLSCREEN_SCALE_DEFAULT

   Specifies that the DOM element should not be resized by Emscripten
   runtime when transitioning between fullscreen and windowed modes.
   The browser will be responsible for scaling the DOM element to the
   fullscreen size. The proper browser behavior in this mode is to
   stretch the element to fit the full display ignoring aspect ratio,
   but at the time of writing, browsers implement different behavior
   here. See the discussion at
   https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/2556 for more
   information.

EMSCRIPTEN_FULLSCREEN_SCALE_STRETCH

   Specifies that the Emscripten runtime should explicitly stretch the
   CSS size of the target element to cover the whole screen when
   trasnsitioning to fullscreen mode. This will change the aspect
   ratio of the displayed content.

EMSCRIPTEN_FULLSCREEN_SCALE_ASPECT

   Specifies that the Emscripten runtime should explicitly scale the
   CSS size of the target element to cover the whole screen, while
   adding either vertical or horizontal black letterbox padding to
   preserve the aspect ratio of the content. The aspect ratio that is
   used here is the render target size of the canvas element. To
   change the desired aspect ratio, call
   "emscripten_set_canvas_size()" before entering fullscreen mode.

EMSCRIPTEN_FULLSCREEN_CANVAS_SCALE

   An enum-like type which specifies how the Emscripten runtime should
   treat the pixel size (render target resolution) of the target
   canvas element when displaying it in fullscreen mode via calls to
   functions "emscripten_request_fullscreen_strategy()" and
   "emscripten_enter_soft_fullscreen()". To better understand the
   underlying distinction between the CSS size of a canvas element
   versus the render target size of a canvas element, see
   https://www.khronos.org/webgl/wiki/HandlingHighDPI.

EMSCRIPTEN_FULLSCREEN_CANVAS_SCALE_NONE

   Specifies that the Emscripten runtime should not do any changes to
   the render target resolution of the target canvas element that is
   displayed in fullscreen mode. Use this mode when your application
   is set up to render to a single fixed resolution that cannot be
   changed under any condition.

EMSCRIPTEN_FULLSCREEN_CANVAS_SCALE_STDDEF

   Specifies that the Emscripten runtime should resize the render
   target of the canvas element to match 1:1 with the CSS size of the
   element in fullscreen mode. On high DPI displays
   (*window.devicePixelRatio* > 1), the CSS size is not the same as
   the physical screen resolution of the device. Call
   "emscripten_get_device_pixel_ratio()" to obtain the pixel ratio
   between CSS pixels and actual device pixels of the screen. Use this
   mode when you want to render to a pixel resolution that is DPI-
   independent.

EMSCRIPTEN_FULLSCREEN_CANVAS_SCALE_HIDEF

   Specifies that the Emscripten runtime should resize the canvas
   render target size to match 1:1 with the physical screen resolution
   on the device. This corresponds to high definition displays on
   retina iOS and other mobile and desktop devices with high DPI. Use
   this mode to match and render 1:1 to the native display resolution.

EMSCRIPTEN_FULLSCREEN_FILTERING

   An enum-like type that specifies what kind of image filtering
   algorithm to apply to the element when it is presented in
   fullscreen mode.

EMSCRIPTEN_FULLSCREEN_FILTERING_DEFAULT

   Specifies that the image filtering mode should not be changed from
   the existing setting in the CSS style.

EMSCRIPTEN_FULLSCREEN_FILTERING_NEAREST

   Applies a CSS style to the element that displays the content using
   a nearest-neighbor image filtering algorithm in fullscreen mode.

EMSCRIPTEN_FULLSCREEN_FILTERING_BILINEAR

   Applies a CSS style to the element that displays the content using
   a bilinear image filtering algorithm in fullscreen mode. This is
   the default browser behavior.


Struct
------

EmscriptenFullscreenChangeEvent

   The event structure passed in the fullscreenchange event.

   EM_BOOL isFullscreen

      Specifies whether an element on the browser page is currently
      fullscreen.

   EM_BOOL fullscreenEnabled

      Specifies if the current page has the ability to display
      elements fullscreen.

   EM_UTF8 nodeName

      The nodeName of the target HTML Element that is in full screen
      mode.

      Maximum size 128 "char" (i.e. "EM_UTF8 nodeName[128]").

      If "isFullscreen" is "false", then "nodeName", "id" and
      "elementWidth" and "ElementHeight" specify information about the
      element that just exited fullscreen mode.

   EM_UTF8 id

      The ID of the target HTML element that is in full screen mode.

      Maximum size 128 "char" (i.e. "EM_UTF8 id[128]").

   int elementWidth
   int elementHeight

      The new pixel size of the element that changed fullscreen
      status.

   int screenWidth
   int screenHeight

      The size of the whole screen, in pixels.

EmscriptenFullscreenStrategy

   The options structure that is passed in to functions
   "emscripten_request_fullscreen_strategy()" and
   "emscripten_enter_soft_fullscreen()" to configure how the target
   element should be displayed in fullscreen mode.

   EMSCRIPTEN_FULLSCREEN_SCALE scaleMode

      Specifies the rule how the CSS size (the displayed size) of the
      target element is resized when displayed in fullscreen mode.

   EMSCRIPTEN_FULLSCREEN_CANVAS_SCALE canvasResolutionScaleMode

      Specifies how the render target size (the pixel resolution) of
      the target element is adjusted when displayed in fullscreen
      mode.

   EMSCRIPTEN_FULLSCREEN_FILTERING filteringMode

      Specifies the image filtering algorithm to apply to the element
      in fullscreen mode.

   em_canvasresized_callback_func canvasResizedCallback

      If nonzero, points to a user-provided callback function which
      will be called whenever either the CSS or the canvas render
      target size changes. Use this callback to reliably obtain
      information about canvas resize events.

   void *canvasResizedCallbackUserData

      Stores a custom data field which will be passed to all calls to
      the user-provided callback function.


Callback functions
------------------

em_fullscreenchange_callback_func

   Function pointer for the "fullscreen event callback functions",
   defined as:

      typedef EM_BOOL (*em_fullscreenchange_callback_func)(int eventType, const EmscriptenFullscreenChangeEvent *fullscreenChangeEvent, void *userData);

   Parameters:
      * **eventType** (*int*) -- The type of fullscreen event
        ("EMSCRIPTEN_EVENT_FULLSCREENCHANGE").

      * **fullscreenChangeEvent** (*const EmscriptenFullscreenChangeEvent**) --
        Information about the fullscreen event that occurred.

      * **userData** (*void**) -- The "userData" originally passed
        to the registration function.

   Returns:
      "true" (non zero) to indicate that the event was consumed by the
      *callback handler*.

   Return type:
      "EM_BOOL"


Functions
---------

EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT emscripten_set_fullscreenchange_callback(const char *target, void *userData, EM_BOOL useCapture, em_fullscreenchange_callback_func callback)

   Registers a callback function for receiving the fullscreenchange
   event.

   Parameters:
      * **target** (*const char**) -- *Target HTML element id*.

      * **userData** (*void**) -- *User-defined data* to be passed
        to the callback (opaque to the API).

      * **useCapture** (*EM_BOOL*) -- Set "true" to *use capture*.

      * **callback** (*em_fullscreenchange_callback_func*) -- A
        callback function. The function is called with the type of
        event, information about the event, and user data passed from
        this registration function. The callback should return "true"
        if the event is consumed.

   Returns:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_SUCCESS", or one of the other result values.

   Return type:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT"

EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT emscripten_get_fullscreen_status(EmscriptenFullscreenChangeEvent *fullscreenStatus)

   Returns the current page fullscreen state.

   Parameters:
      * **fullscreenStatus** (*EmscriptenFullscreenChangeEvent**) --
        The most recently received fullscreen state.

   Returns:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_SUCCESS", or one of the other result values.

   Return type:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT"

EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT emscripten_request_fullscreen(const char *target, EM_BOOL deferUntilInEventHandler)

   Requests the given target element to transition to full screen
   mode.

   Note: This function can be called anywhere, but for web security
     reasons its associated *request* can only be raised inside the
     event handler for a user-generated event (for example a key,
     mouse or touch press/release). This has implications for porting
     and the value of "deferUntilInEventHandler"  — see *Functions
     affected by web security* for more information.

   Note: This function only performs a fullscreen request without
     changing any parameters of the DOM element that is to be
     displayed in fullscreen mode. At the time of writing, there are
     differences in how browsers present elements in fullscreen mode.
     For more information, read the discussion at
     https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/2556. To display an
     element in fullscreen mode in a way that is consistent across
     browsers, prefer calling the function
     "emscripten_request_fullscreen_strategy()" instead. This function
     is best called only in scenarios where the preconfigured presets
     defined by "emscripten_request_fullscreen_strategy()" conflict
     with the developer's use case in some way.

   Parameters:
      * **target** (*const char**) -- *Target HTML element id*.

      * **deferUntilInEventHandler** (*EM_BOOL*) -- If "true"
        requests made outside of a user-generated event handler are
        automatically deferred until the user next presses a keyboard
        or mouse button. If "false" the request will fail if called
        outside of a user-generated event handler.

   Returns:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_SUCCESS", or one of the other result values.

   Return type:
      **EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT**

EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT emscripten_request_fullscreen_strategy(const char *target, EM_BOOL deferUntilInEventHandler, const EmscriptenFullscreenStrategy *fullscreenStrategy)

   Requests the given target element to transition to full screen
   mode, using a custom presentation mode for the element. This
   function is otherwise the same as
   "emscripten_request_fullscreen()", but this function adds options
   to control how resizing and aspect ratio, and ensures that the
   behavior is consistent across browsers.

   Note: This function makes changes to the DOM to satisfy
     consistent presentation across browsers. These changes have been
     designed to intrude as little as possible, and the changes are
     cleared once windowed browsing is restored. If any of these
     changes are conflicting, see the function
     "emscripten_request_fullscreen()" instead, which performs a bare
     fullscreen request without any modifications to the DOM.

   Parameters:
      * **EmscriptenFullscreenStrategy *fullscreenStrategy**
        (*const*) --

        [in] Points to a configuration structure filled by the caller
        which specifies display options for the fullscreen mode.

EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT emscripten_exit_fullscreen(void)

   Returns back to windowed browsing mode from a proper fullscreen
   mode.

   Do not call this function to attempt to return to windowed browsing
   mode from a soft fullscreen mode, or vice versa.

   Returns:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_SUCCESS", or one of the other result values.

   Return type:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT"

EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT emscripten_enter_soft_fullscreen(const char *target, const EmscriptenFullscreenStrategy *fullscreenStrategy)

   Enters a "soft" fullscreen mode, where the given target element is
   displayed in the whole client area of the page and all other
   elements are hidden, but does not actually request fullscreen mode
   for the browser. This function is useful in cases where the actual
   Fullscreen API is not desirable or needed, for example in packaged
   apps for Firefox OS, where applications essentially already cover
   the whole screen.

   Pressing the esc button does not automatically exit the soft
   fullscreen mode. To return to windowed presentation mode, manually
   call the function "emscripten_exit_soft_fullscreen()".

EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT emscripten_exit_soft_fullscreen()

   Returns back to windowed browsing mode from a soft fullscreen mode.
   Do not call this function to attempt to return to windowed browsing
   mode from a real fullscreen mode, or vice versa.

      *callback handler*.

   Return type:
      "EM_BOOL"


Functions
---------

EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT emscripten_set_pointerlockchange_callback(const char *target, void *userData, EM_BOOL useCapture, em_pointerlockchange_callback_func callback)

   Registers a callback function for receiving the pointerlockchange
   event.

   Pointer lock hides the mouse cursor and exclusively gives the
   target element relative mouse movement events via the mousemove
   event.

   Parameters:
      * **target** (*const char**) -- *Target HTML element id*.

      * **userData** (*void**) -- *User-defined data* to be passed
        to the callback (opaque to the API).

      * **useCapture** (*EM_BOOL*) -- Set "true" to *use capture*.

      * **callback** (*em_pointerlockchange_callback_func*) -- A
        callback function. The function is called with the type of
        event, information about the event, and user data passed from
        this registration function. The callback should return "true"
        if the event is consumed.

   Returns:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_SUCCESS", or one of the other result values.

   Return type:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT"

EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT emscripten_get_pointerlock_status(EmscriptenPointerlockChangeEvent *pointerlockStatus)

   Returns the current page pointerlock state.

   Parameters:
      * **pointerlockStatus** (*EmscriptenPointerlockChangeEvent**)
        -- The most recently received pointerlock state.

   Returns:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_SUCCESS", or one of the other result values.

   Return type:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT"

EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT emscripten_request_pointerlock(const char *target, EM_BOOL deferUntilInEventHandler)

   Requests the given target element to grab pointerlock.

   Note: This function can be called anywhere, but for web security
     reasons its associated *request* can only be raised inside the
     event handler for a user-generated event (for example a key,
     mouse or touch press/release). This has implications for porting
     and the value of "deferUntilInEventHandler"  — see *Functions
     affected by web security* for more information.

   Parameters:
      * **target** (*const char**) -- *Target HTML element id*.

      * **deferUntilInEventHandler** (*EM_BOOL*) -- If "true"
        requests made outside of a user-generated event handler are
        automatically deferred until the user next presses a keyboard
        or mouse button. If "false" the request will fail if called
        outside of a user-generated event handler.

   Returns:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_SUCCESS", or one of the other result values.

   Return type:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT"

EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT emscripten_exit_pointerlock(void)

   Exits pointer lock state and restores the mouse cursor to be
   visible again.

   Returns:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_SUCCESS", or one of the other result values.

WebGL context
=============


Defines
-------

EMSCRIPTEN_EVENT_WEBGLCONTEXTLOST
EMSCRIPTEN_EVENT_WEBGLCONTEXTRESTORED

   Emscripten WebGL context events.

EMSCRIPTEN_WEBGL_CONTEXT_HANDLE

   Represents a handle to an Emscripten WebGL context object. The
   value 0 denotes an invalid/no context (this is a typedef to an
   "int").


Struct
------

EmscriptenWebGLContextAttributes

   Specifies WebGL context creation parameters.

   EM_BOOL alpha

      If "true", request an alpha channel for the context. If you
      create an alpha channel, you can blend the canvas rendering with
      the underlying web page contents. Default value: "true".

   EM_BOOL depth

      If "true", request a depth buffer of at least 16 bits. If
      "false", no depth buffer will be initialized. Default value:
      "true".

   EM_BOOL stencil

      If "true", request a stencil buffer of at least 8 bits. If
      "false", no stencil buffer will be initialized. Default value:
      "false".

   EM_BOOL antialias

      If "true", antialiasing will be initialized with a browser-
      specified algorithm and quality level. If "false", antialiasing
      is disabled. Default value: "true".

   EM_BOOL premultipliedAlpha

      If "true", the alpha channel of the rendering context will be
      treated as representing premultiplied alpha values. If "false",
      the alpha channel represents non-premultiplied alpha. Default
      value: "true".

   EM_BOOL preserveDrawingBuffer

      If "true", the contents of the drawing buffer are preserved
      between consecutive "requestAnimationFrame()" calls. If "false",
      color, depth and stencil are cleared at the beginning of each
      "requestAnimationFrame()". Generally setting this to "false"
      gives better performance. Default value: "false".

   EM_BOOL preferLowPowerToHighPerformance

      If "true", hints the browser to initialize a low-power GPU
      rendering context. If "false", prefers to initialize a high-
      performance rendering context. Default value: "false".

   EM_BOOL failIfMajorPerformanceCaveat

      If "true", requests context creation to abort if the browser is
      only able to create a context that does not give good hardware-
      accelerated performance. Default value: "false".

   int majorVersion
   int minorVersion

      Emscripten-specific extensions which specify the WebGL context
      version to initialize.

      For example, pass in "majorVersion=1", "minorVersion=0" to
      request a WebGL 1.0 context, and "majorVersion=2",
      "minorVersion=0" to request a WebGL 2.0 context.

      Default value: "majorVersion=1", "minorVersion=0"

   EM_BOOL enableExtensionsByDefault

      If "true", all GLES2-compatible non-performance-impacting WebGL
      extensions will automatically be enabled for you after the
      context has been created. If "false", no extensions are enabled
      by default, and you need to manually call
      "emscripten_webgl_enable_extension()" to enable each extension
      that you want to use. Default value: "true".

   Queries the given canvas element for whether its WebGL context is
   in a lost state.

   Parameters:
      * **target** (*const char**) -- Reserved for future use, pass
        in 0.

   Returns:
      "true" if the WebGL context is in a lost state.

   Return type:
      "EM_BOOL"

void emscripten_webgl_init_context_attributes(EmscriptenWebGLContextAttributes *attributes)

   Populates all fields of the given
   "EmscriptenWebGLContextAttributes" structure to their default
   values for use with WebGL 1.0.

   Call this function as a forward-compatible way to ensure that if
   there are new fields added to the
   "EmscriptenWebGLContextAttributes" structure in the future, that
   they also will get default-initialized without having to change any
   code.

   Parameters:
      * **attributes** (*EmscriptenWebGLContextAttributes**) -- The
        structure to be populated.

EMSCRIPTEN_WEBGL_CONTEXT_HANDLE emscripten_webgl_create_context(const char *target, const EmscriptenWebGLContextAttributes *attributes)

   Creates and returns a new WebGL context.

   Note: * A successful call to this function will not immediately
     make

       that rendering context active. Call
       "emscripten_webgl_make_context_current()" after creating a
       context to activate it.

     * This function will try to initialize the context version that
       was *exactly* requested. It will not e.g. initialize a newer
       backwards-compatible version or similar.

   Parameters:
      * **target** (*const char**) -- The DOM canvas element in
        which to initialize the WebGL context. If 0 is passed, the
        element specified by "Module.canvas" will be used.

      * **attributes** (*EmscriptenWebGLContextAttributes**) -- The
        attributes of the requested context version.

   Returns:
      On success, a strictly positive value that represents a handle
      to the created context. On failure, a negative number that can
      be cast to an "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT" field to get the reason why
      the context creation failed.

   Return type:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_WEBGL_CONTEXT_HANDLE"

EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT emscripten_webgl_make_context_current(EMSCRIPTEN_WEBGL_CONTEXT_HANDLE context)

   Activates the given WebGL context for rendering. After calling this
   function, all OpenGL functions ("glBindBuffer()", "glDrawArrays()",
   etc.) can be applied to the given GL context.

   Parameters:
      * **context** (*EMSCRIPTEN_WEBGL_CONTEXT_HANDLE*) -- The WebGL
        context to activate.

   Returns:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_SUCCESS", or one of the other result values.

   Return type:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT"

EMSCRIPTEN_WEBGL_CONTEXT_HANDLE emscripten_webgl_get_current_context()

   Returns the currently active WebGL rendering context, or 0 if no
   context is active. Calling any WebGL functions when there is no
   active rendering context is undefined and may throw a JavaScript
   exception.

   Returns:
      The currently active WebGL rendering context, or 0 if no context
      is active.

   Return type:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_WEBGL_CONTEXT_HANDLE"

EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT emscripten_webgl_destroy_context(EMSCRIPTEN_WEBGL_CONTEXT_HANDLE context)

   Deletes the given WebGL context. If that context was active, then
   the no context is set to active.

   Parameters:
      * **context** (*EMSCRIPTEN_WEBGL_CONTEXT_HANDLE*) -- The WebGL
        context to delete.

   Returns:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT_SUCCESS", or one of the other result values.

   Return type:
      "EMSCRIPTEN_RESULT"

EM_BOOL emscripten_webgl_enable_extension(EMSCRIPTEN_WEBGL_CONTEXT_HANDLE context, const char *extension)

   Enables the given extension on the given context.

   Parameters:
      * **context** (*EMSCRIPTEN_WEBGL_CONTEXT_HANDLE*) -- The WebGL
        context on which the extension is to be enabled.

      * **extension** (*const char**) -- A string identifyingthea
        WebGL extension. For example "OES_texture_float".

   Returns:
      EM_TRUE if the given extension is supported by the context, and
      EM_FALSE if the extension was not available.

   Return type:
      "EM_BOOL"
