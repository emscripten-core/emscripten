Due  to our  use of  `libtool' to  generate and  install the  FreeType 2
libraries on  Unix systems, as  well as  other historical events,  it is
generally very  difficult to  know precisely which  release of  the font
engine is installed on a given system.

This file tries  to explain why and to document  ways to properly detect
FreeType on Unix.


1. Version and Release numbers
------------------------------

For each new  public release of FreeType 2, there  are generally *three*
distinct `version' numbers to consider:

  * The official FreeType 2 release number, like 2.3.1 or 2.4.10.

  * The libtool (and  Unix) specific version number,  like 13.0.7.  This
    is what `freetype-config --version' returns.

  * The platform-specific  shared object  number, used for  example when
    the library is installed as `/usr/lib/libfreetype.so.6.7.1'.

The platform-specific  number is, unsurprisingly,  platform-specific and
varies  with the  operating system  you are  using (several  variants of
Linux, FreeBSD,  Solaris, etc.).  You  should thus _never_ use  it, even
for simple tests.

The libtool-specific  number does  not equal the  release number  but is
tied to it.

The release number is available  at *compile* time through the following
macros defined in FT_FREETYPE_H:

  - FREETYPE_MAJOR: major release number
  - FREETYPE_MINOR: minor release number
  - FREETYPE_PATCH: patch release number

See below for a small autoconf fragment.

The  release  number   is  also  available  at   *runtime*  through  the
`FT_Library_Version' API.


2. History
----------

The  following   table  gives,  for   all  releases  since   2.4.0,  the
corresponding libtool number, as well  as the shared object number found
on _most_ systems, but not all of them:

     2.4.0      11.0.5    6.5.0


3. Autoconf Code Fragment
-------------------------

Lars Clausen contributed the following autoconf fragment to detect which
version of  FreeType is  installed on  a system.  This  one tests  for a
version that  is at least 2.0.9;  you should change it  to check against
other release numbers.


  AC_MSG_CHECKING([whether FreeType version is 2.0.9 or higher])
  old_CPPFLAGS="$CPPFLAGS"
  CPPFLAGS=`freetype-config --cflags`
  AC_TRY_CPP([

#include <ft2build.h>
#include FT_FREETYPE_H
#if (FREETYPE_MAJOR*1000 + FREETYPE_MINOR)*1000 + FREETYPE_PATCH < 2000009
#error Freetype version too low.
#endif
  ],
  [AC_MSG_RESULT(yes)
   FREETYPE_LIBS=`freetype-config --libs`
   AC_SUBST(FREETYPE_LIBS)
   AC_DEFINE(HAVE_FREETYPE,1,[Define if you have the FreeType2 library])
   CPPFLAGS="$old_CPPFLAGS"],
  [AC_MSG_ERROR([Need FreeType library version 2.0.9 or higher])])
