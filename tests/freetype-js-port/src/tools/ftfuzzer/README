ftfuzzer
========


ftfuzzer.cc
-----------

This file contains a target function  for FreeType fuzzing.  It can be
used    with   libFuzzer    (http://llvm.org/docs/LibFuzzer.html)   or
potentially any other similar fuzzer.

Usage:

  1. Build  `libfreetype.a' and  `ftfuzzer.cc' using  the most  recent
     clang compiler with these flags:

       # for fuzzer coverage feedback
       -fsanitize-coverage=edge,8bit-counters
       # for bug checking
       -fsanitize=address,signed-integer-overflow,shift

     You  also need  the header  files from  the `libarchive'  library
     (http://www.libarchive.org/)  for handling  tar  files (see  file
     `ftmutator.cc' below for more).

  2. Link with `libFuzzer' (it contains `main') and `libarchive'.

  3. Run the fuzzer on some test corpus.

The exact flags and commands may vary.


There is a continuous fuzzing bot that runs ftfuzzer.

Check the bot configuration for the most current settings.


ftmutator.cc
------------

FreeType has the  ability to `attach' auxiliary files to  a font file,
providing additional information.  The main usage is to load AFM files
for PostScript Type 1 fonts.

However, libFuzzer currently only supports  mutation of a single input
file.   For  this  reason,  `ftmutator.cc' contains  a  custom  fuzzer
mutator that uses an uncompressed tar  file archive as the input.  The
first file in  such a tarball gets  opened by FreeType as  a font, all
other files are treated as input for `FT_Attach_Stream'.

Compilation is similar to `ftfuzzer.c'.


runinput.cc
-----------

To run the target function on a set of input files, this file contains
a   convenience  `main'   function.   Link   it  with   `ftfuzzer.cc',
`libfreetype.a', and `libarchive' and run like

  ./a.out my_tests_inputs/*
