#### font modules -- at least one is required
####
####   The order given here (from top to down) is the order used for testing
####   font formats in the compiled library.
####

# TrueType font driver.
#
# This driver needs the `sfnt' module.
FONT_MODULES += truetype

# PostScript Type 1 font driver.
#
# This driver needs the `psaux', `pshinter', and `psnames' modules.
#MRW FONT_MODULES += type1

# CFF/OpenType font driver.
#
# This driver needs the `sfnt', `pshinter', and `psnames' modules.
FONT_MODULES += cff

# Type 1 CID-keyed font driver.
#
# This driver needs the `psaux', `pshinter', and `psnames' modules.
#MRW FONT_MODULES += cid

# PFR/TrueDoc font driver.  See optional extension ftpfr.c below also.
#MRW FONT_MODULES += pfr

# PostScript Type 42 font driver.
#
# This driver needs the `truetype' and `psaux' modules.
#MRW FONT_MODULES += type42

# Windows FONT/FNT font driver.  See optional extension ftwinfnt.c below
# also.

# PCF font driver.
#MRW FONT_MODULES += pcf

# BDF font driver.  See optional extension ftbdf.c below also.
#MRW FONT_MODULES += bdf

# bitmap-only fonts within an SFNT wrapper.
#
# This driver needs the `psnames' module.

#### hinting modules
####
