emcc - compiler helper script
=============================

emcc is a drop-in replacement for a compiler like gcc or clang.

Tell your build system to use this instead of the compiler, and similarly
use emar, emranlib etc. instead of the same command without 'em'.

Example uses:

 * For configure, instead of ./configure, cmake, etc., run emconfigure.py
   with that command as an argument, for example

    emconfigure.py ./configure [options]
  
   emconfigure.py is a tiny script that just sets some environment vars
   as a convenience. The command just shown is equivalent to

    EMMAKEN_JUST_CONFIGURE=1 RANLIB=PATH/emranlib AR=PATH/emar CXX=PATH/em++ CC=PATH/emcc ./configure [options]

   where PATH is the path to this file.

   EMMAKEN_JUST_CONFIGURE tells emcc that it is being run in ./configure,
   so it should relay everything to gcc/g++. You should not define that when
   running make, of course.

 * With CMake, the same command will work (with cmake instead of ./configure). You may also be
   able to do the following in your CMakeLists.txt:

    SET(CMAKE_C_COMPILER "PATH/emcc")
    SET(CMAKE_CXX_COMPILER "PATH/em++")
    SET(CMAKE_LINKER "PATH/emcc")
    SET(CMAKE_CXX_LINKER "PATH/emcc")
    SET(CMAKE_C_LINK_EXECUTABLE "PATH/emcc")
    SET(CMAKE_CXX_LINK_EXECUTABLE "PATH/emcc")
    SET(CMAKE_AR "PATH/emar")
    SET(CMAKE_RANLIB "PATH/emranlib")

 * For SCons the shared.py can be imported like so:
    __file__ = str(Dir('#/project_path_to_emscripten/dummy/dummy'))
    __rootpath__ = os.path.dirname(os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(__file__)))
    def path_from_root(*pathelems):
      return os.path.join(__rootpath__, *pathelems)
    sys.path += [path_from_root('')]
    from tools.shared import *
    
   For using the Emscripten compilers/linkers/etc. you can do:
    env = Environment()
    ...
    env.Append(CCFLAGS = COMPILER_OPTS)
    env.Replace(LINK = LLVM_LD)
    env.Replace(LD   = LLVM_LD)
   TODO: Document all relevant setup changes

After setting that up, run your build system normally.

Note the appearance of em++ instead of emcc
for the C++ compiler. This is needed for cases where we get
a C++ file with a C extension, in which case CMake can be told
to run g++ on it despite the .c extension, see

  https://github.com/kripken/emscripten/issues/6

(If a similar situation occurs with ./configure, you can do the same there too.)

emcc can be influenced by a few environment variables:

  EMMAKEN_NO_SDK - Will tell emcc *not* to use the emscripten headers. Instead
                   your system headers will be used.

  EMMAKEN_COMPILER - The compiler to be used, if you don't want the default clang.

                           compiling to JavaScript, not to intermediate
                           bitcode.
  -O2                      As -O1, plus the relooper (loop recreation),

  -O3                      As -O2, plus dangerous optimizations that may
                           break the generated code! This is not
                           recommended at all, see the wiki for more
                           details (you can try -O2 and then add
                           dangerous optimizations one by one).

  -s OPTION=VALUE          JavaScript code generation option passed

                           Note that for options that are lists, you
                           need quotation marks in most shells, for
                           example

                            -s RUNTIME_LINKED_LIBS="['liblib.so']"

                           (without the external "s in either of those,
                           you would get an error)

  -g                       Use debug info. Note that you need this during
                           the last compilation phase from bitcode to
                           JavaScript, or else we will remove it by
                           default in -O1 and above.

  --typed-arrays <mode>    0: No typed arrays
                           1: Parallel typed arrays
                           2: Shared (C-like) typed arrays (default)

  --llvm-opts <level>      0: No LLVM optimizations (default in -O0)
                           1: -O1 LLVM optimizations (default in -O1)
                           2: -O2 LLVM optimizations
                           3: -O3 LLVM optimizations (default in -O2+)

  --llvm-lto <level>       0: No LLVM LTO (default in -O0)
                           1: LLVM LTO (default in -O1+)
                           Note: If LLVM optimizations are not run
                           (see --llvm-opts), setting this to 1 has no
                           effect.

  --closure <on>           0: No closure compiler (default in -O0, -O1)
                           1: Run closure compiler (default in -O2, -O3)

  --js-transform <cmd>     <cmd> will be called on the generated code
                           before it is optimized. This lets you modify
                           the JavaScript, for example adding some code
                           or removing some code, in a way that those
                           modifications will be optimized together with
                           the generated code properly. <cmd> will be
                           called with the filename of the generated
                           code as a parameter; to modify the code, you
                           can read the original data and then append to
                           it or overwrite it with the modified data.
                           <cmd> is interpreted as a space-separated
                           list of arguments, for example, <cmd> of
                           "python processor.py" will cause a python
                           script to be run.

  --pre-js <file>          A file whose contents are added before the
                           generated code. This is done *before*
                           optimization, so it will be minified
                           properly if closure compiler is run.

  --post-js <file>         A file whose contents are added after the
                           generated code This is done *before*
                           optimization, so it will be minified
                           properly if closure compiler is run.

  --embed-file <file>      A file to embed inside the generated
                           JavaScript. The compiled code will be able
                           to access the file in the current directory
                           with the same name as given here. So if
                           you do --embed-file dir/file.dat, then
                           (1) dir/file.dat must exist relative to
                           where you run emcc, and (2) your compiled
                           code will be able to find the file by
                           reading that same path, dir/file.dat.
                           If a directory is passed here, its entire
                           contents will be embedded.

  --preload-file <name>    A file to preload before running the
                           compiled code asynchronously. Otherwise
                           similar to --embed-file, except that this
                           option is only relevant when generating
                           HTML (it uses asynchronous binary XHRs),
                           or JS that will be used in a web page.
                           If a directory is passed here, its entire
                           contents will be preloaded.
                           Preloaded files are stored in filename.data,
                           where filename.html is the main file you
                           are compiling to. To run your code, you
                           will need both the .html and the .data.

  --compression <codec>    Compress both the compiled code and embedded/
                           preloaded files. <codec> should be a triple,

                              <native_encoder>,<js_decoder>,<js_name>

                           where native_encoder is a native executable
                           that compresses stdin to stdout (the simplest
                           possible interface), js_decoder is a
                           JavaScript file that implements a decoder,
                           and js_name is the name of the function to
                           call in the decoder file (which should
                           receive an array/typed array and return
                           an array/typed array.
                           Compression only works when generating HTML.
                           When compression is on, all filed specified
                           to be preloaded are compressed in one big
                           archive, which is given the same name as the
                           output HTML but with suffix .data.compress

  --minify <on>            0: Do not minify the generated JavaScript's
                              whitespace (default if closure compiler
                              will not be run)
                           1: Minify the generated JavaScript's
                              whitespace (default if closure compiler
                              will be run). Note that this by itself
                              will not minify the code (closure does
                              that)

  --split <size>           Splits the resulting javascript file into pieces
                           to ease debugging. This option only works if
                           Javascript is generated (target -o <name>.js).
                           Files with function declarations must be loaded
                           before main file upon execution.

                           Without "-g" option:
                              Creates files with function declarations up
                              to the given size with the suffix
                              "_functions.partxxx.js" and a main file with
                              the suffix ".js".

                           With "-g" option:
                              Recreates the directory structure of the C
                              source files and stores function declarations
                              in their respective C files with the suffix
                              ".js". If such a file exceeds the given size,
                              files with the suffix ".partxxx.js" are created.
                              The main file resides in the base directory and
                              has the suffix ".js".

  --bind                   Compiles the source code using the "embind"
                           bindings approach, which connects C/C++ and JS.

  --ignore-dynamic-linking Normally emcc will treat dynamic linking like
                           static linking, by linking in the code from
                           the dynamic library. This fails if the same
                           dynamic library is linked more than once.
                           With this option, dynamic linking is ignored,
                           which allows the build system to proceed without
                           errors. However, you will need to manually
                           link to the shared libraries later on yourself.

  --shell-file <path>      The path name to a skeleton HTML file used
                           when generating HTML output. The shell file
                           used needs to have this token inside it:
                           {{{ SCRIPT_CODE }}}
                           Note that this argument is ignored if a
                           target other than HTML is specified using
                           the -o option.

  --js-library <lib>       A JavaScript library to use in addition to
                           those in Emscripten's src/library_*

  -v                       Turns on verbose output. This will pass
                           -v to Clang, and also enable EMCC_DEBUG
                           to details emcc's operations

  --jcache                 Use a JavaScript cache. This is disabled by
                           default. When enabled, emcc will store the
                           results of compilation in a cache and check
                           the cache when compiling later, something
                           like what ccache does. This allows incremental
                           builds - where you are compiling a large
                           program but only modified a small part of it -
                           to be much faster (at the cost of more disk
                           IO for cache accesses). Note that you need
                           to enable --jcache for both loading and saving
                           of data, so you must enable it on a full build
                           for a later incremental build (where you also
                           enable it) to be sped up.

  --clear-cache            Manually clears the cache of compiled
                           emscripten system libraries (libc++,
                           libc++abi, libc). This is normally
                           handled automatically, but if you update
                           llvm in-place (instead of having a different
                           directory for a new version), the caching
                           mechanism can get confused. Clearing the
                           cache can fix weird problems related to
                           cache incompatibilities, like clang failing
                           to link with library files. This also clears
                           other cached data like the jcache and
                           the bootstrapped relooper. After the cache
                           is cleared, this process will exit.

The target file, if specified (-o <target>), defines what will
be generated:

  <name>.js                JavaScript
  <name>.html              HTML with embedded JavaScript
  <name>.bc                LLVM bitcode (default)
  <name>.o                 LLVM bitcode (same as .bc)

The -c option (which tells gcc not to run the linker) will
cause LLVM bitcode to be generated, as %s only generates
JavaScript in the final linking stage of building.

The input file(s) can be either source code files that
Clang can handle (C or C++), LLVM bitcode in binary form,
or LLVM assembly files in human-readable form.

emcc is affected by several environment variables. For details, view
the source of emcc (search for 'os.environ').
