HTML Template Files
===================

The files in this directory are html templates used by emscripten when
generating html output.  These are only used when the output of the compiler
has the `.html` suffix (or when `-oformat=html` is specified).

By default the `shell.html` file in this directory is used but an alternative
can be specified using the `--shell-file` flag.
