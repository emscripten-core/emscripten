   *   LCD Filtering

   *   Reduce color fringes of LCD-optimized bitmaps.
   *
   * @description:
   *   The @FT_Library_SetLcdFilter API can be used to specify a low-pass
   *   filter which is then applied to LCD-optimized bitmaps generated
   *   through @FT_Render_Glyph.  This is useful to reduce color fringes
   *   which would occur with unfiltered rendering.
   *
   *   Note that no filter is active by default, and that this function is
   *   *not* implemented in default builds of the library.  You need to
   *   #define FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_RENDERING in your `ftoption.h' file
   *   in order to activate it.

   *   A list of values to identify various types of LCD filters.
   *
   * @values:
   *   FT_LCD_FILTER_NONE ::
   *     Do not perform filtering.  When used with subpixel rendering, this
   *     results in sometimes severe color fringes.
   *
   *   FT_LCD_FILTER_DEFAULT ::
   *     The default filter reduces color fringes considerably, at the cost
   *     of a slight blurriness in the output.
   *
   *   FT_LCD_FILTER_LIGHT ::
   *     The light filter is a variant that produces less blurriness at the
   *     cost of slightly more color fringes than the default one.  It might
   *     be better, depending on taste, your monitor, or your personal vision.
   *
   *   FT_LCD_FILTER_LEGACY ::
   *     This filter corresponds to the original libXft color filter.  It
   *     provides high contrast output but can exhibit really bad color
   *     fringes if glyphs are not extremely well hinted to the pixel grid.
   *     In other words, it only works well if the TrueType bytecode
   *     interpreter is enabled *and* high-quality hinted fonts are used.
   *
   *     This filter is only provided for comparison purposes, and might be
   *     disabled or stay unsupported in the future.

   * @since:
   *   2.3.0

   * @description:
   *   This function is used to apply color filtering to LCD decimated
   *   bitmaps, like the ones used when calling @FT_Render_Glyph with
   *   @FT_RENDER_MODE_LCD or @FT_RENDER_MODE_LCD_V.
   *
   * @input:
   *   library ::
   *     A handle to the target library instance.
   *
   *   filter ::
   *     The filter type.
   *
   *     You can use @FT_LCD_FILTER_NONE here to disable this feature, or
   *     @FT_LCD_FILTER_DEFAULT to use a default filter that should work
   *     well on most LCD screens.
   *
   * @return:
   *   FreeType error code.  0~means success.
   *
   * @note:
   *   This feature is always disabled by default.  Clients must make an
   *   explicit call to this function with a `filter' value other than
   *   @FT_LCD_FILTER_NONE in order to enable it.
   *
   *   Due to *PATENTS* covering subpixel rendering, this function doesn't
   *   do anything except returning `FT_Err_Unimplemented_Feature' if the
   *   configuration macro FT_CONFIG_OPTION_SUBPIXEL_RENDERING is not
   *   defined in your build of the library, which should correspond to all
   *   default builds of FreeType.
   *
   *   The filter affects glyph bitmaps rendered through @FT_Render_Glyph,
   *   @FT_Outline_Get_Bitmap, @FT_Load_Glyph, and @FT_Load_Char.
   *
   *   It does _not_ affect the output of @FT_Outline_Render and
   *   @FT_Outline_Get_Bitmap.
   *
   *   If this feature is activated, the dimensions of LCD glyph bitmaps are
   *   either larger or taller than the dimensions of the corresponding
   *   outline with regards to the pixel grid.  For example, for
   *   @FT_RENDER_MODE_LCD, the filter adds up to 3~pixels to the left, and
   *   up to 3~pixels to the right.
   *
   *   The bitmap offset values are adjusted correctly, so clients shouldn't
   *   need to modify their layout and glyph positioning code when enabling
   *   the filter.
