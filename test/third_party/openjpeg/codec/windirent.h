 * Revision 1.7  2002/05/13 10:48:35  tr
 * embedded some source code directly to the header so that no source
 * modules need to be included in the MS Visual C project using the
 * interface, removed all the dependencies to other headers of the `uce'
 * library so that the header can be made public
 *
 * Revision 1.6  2002/04/12 16:22:04  tr
 * Unified Compiling Environment (UCE) replaced `std' library
 *
 * Revision 1.5  2001/07/20 16:33:40  tr
 * moved to `std' library and re-named defines accordingly
 *
 * Revision 1.4  2001/07/10 16:47:18  tronkko
 * revised comments
 *
 * Revision 1.3  2001/01/11 13:16:43  tr
 * using ``uce-machine.h'' for finding out defines such as `FREEBSD'

 * MSVC 1.0 scans automatic dependencies incorrectly when your project
 * contains this very header.  The problem is that MSVC cannot handle
 * include directives inside #if..#endif block those are never entered.
 * Since this header ought to compile in many different operating systems,
 * there had to be several conditional blocks that are compiled only in
 * operating systems for what they were designed for.  MSVC 1.0 cannot
 * handle inclusion of sys/dir.h in a part that is compiled only in Apollo
 * operating system.  To fix the problem you need to insert DIR.H into
 * SYSINCL.DAT located in MSVC\BIN directory and restart visual C++.
 * Consult manuals for more informaton about the problem.
 *
 * Since many UNIX systems have dirent.h we assume to have one also.
 * However, if your UNIX system does not have dirent.h you can download one
 * for example at: http://ftp.uni-mannheim.de/ftp/GNU/dirent/dirent.tar.gz.
 * You can also see if you have one of dirent.h, direct.h, dir.h, ndir.h,
 * sys/dir.h and sys/ndir.h somewhere.  Try defining HAVE_DIRENT_H,
 * HAVE_DIRECT_H, HAVE_DIR_H, HAVE_NDIR_H, HAVE_SYS_DIR_H and
 * HAVE_SYS_NDIR_H according to the files found.

 * include normal files, sub-directories, pseudo-directories "." and ".."
 * and also volume labels, hidden files and system files in MS-DOS and
 * MS-Windows.   You might want to use stat(2) function to determinate which
 * one are you dealing with.  Many dirent implementations already contain
 * equivalent information in dirent structure but you cannot depend on
 * this.
 *
 * The dirent structure contains several system dependent fields that
 * generally have no interest to you.  The only interesting one is char
 * d_name[] that is also portable across different systems.  The d_name
 * field contains the name of the directory entry without leading path.
 * While d_name is portable across different systems the actual storage
 * capacity of d_name varies from system to system and there is no portable
 * way to find out it at compile time as different systems define the
 * capacity of d_name with different macros and some systems do not define
 * capacity at all (besides actual declaration of the field). If you really
 * need to find out storage capacity of d_name then you might want to try
 * NAME_MAX macro. The NAME_MAX is defined in POSIX standard althought
 * there are many MS-DOS and MS-Windows implementations those do not define
 * it.  There are also systems that declare d_name as "char d_name[1]" and
 * then allocate suitable amount of memory at run-time.  Thanks to Alain
 * Decamps (Alain.Decamps@advalvas.be) for pointing it out to me.
 *
 * This all leads to the fact that it is difficult to allocate space
 * for the directory names when the very same program is being compiled on
 * number of operating systems.  Therefore I suggest that you always
 * allocate space for directory names dynamically.
