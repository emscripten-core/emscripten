* [antonin] bug fixes to enable cmake compilation on WIN32 platform
			- fixed getopt bug in jpwl/CMakeLists.txt
			- added png, zlib and lcms win32 libraries to libs directory
			- updated libs/libtiff library
			- moved j2k_dump_{image,cp} to j2k_dump.c to remain consistent with API interface
			- changed mj2 cmake compilation method: as long as mj2 binaries do not strictly use the API interface, libopenjpeg source files are directly included in mj2 executables compilation.
! [antonin] small update to xcode project

December 14, 2010
! [szukw000] adapted Makefile.am/Makefile.nix to build
             choice: shared xor static

December 11, 2010
* [antonin] fixed flags when building jp3d with MinGW

December 10, 2010
! [szukw000] changed build choice in configure.ac/Makefile.am/Makefile.nix:
             shared xor static

December 9, 2010
! [antonin] removed LCMS dependency in jp3d/libjp3dvm/CMakeLists.txt

December 8, 2010 
  (thanks to Winfried for his help)
* [antonin] changed remaining "WIN32" to "_WIN32"
! [antonin] libopenjpeg has no more dependency on LCMS lib. Everything concerning color (icc profile, conversion to rgb, etc) has been put outside libopenjpeg and is used in j2k_to_image.c and mj2_to_frames.c.
- [antonin] removed 'opj_convert{.c,.h}'
+ [antonin] added a directory 'common/' that contains 'getopt{.c,.h}' (previously in 'codec/compat').

February 28, 2008
- [FOD] Removed the J2KViewer module, which has been replaced by OPJViewer
* [FOD] Fixed the error handling of j2k_decode in jp2.c, thanks to Robin Cornelius

* [Parvatha] Patch by Callum Lerwick. Fixed bug during encoding using tile option in tcd.c

----------------------
December 21, 2007
VERSION 1.3.0 RELEASED
----------------------

December 21, 2007
* [FOD] Bug fixed by David Bruken. Fixed memory allocation issue in opj_malloc.h
! [FOD] Possible errors in pi_create_encode handled

December 19, 2007
* [Antonin] changed variables names alpha, beta, gamma, delta in dwt.c to avoid re-declarations on Macosx
! [Parvatha] In pi.c, removed the Recursive function pi_check_next_level() and modified the code.
* [FOD] Fixed allocation problem in pi.c

December 19, 2007
+ [FOD] In mqc.h, changed MQC_NUMCTXS from 32 to 19 as there are only 19 possible contexts

December 10, 2007
+ [FOD] First import of JAVAOpenJPEG, a Java wrapper of OpenJPEG, developed by Patrick Piscaglia of Telemis (www.telemis.com). 
		Thank you Patrick for this new module !

November 29, 2007
! [GB] Added index.h and index.c in VC6 projects; wrapped index.h in the C++ preprocessor; modified OPJViewer project and some files.

November 14, 2007
+ [FOD] Created the file index.c in the codec directory. This file handles the creation of index files, 
		at encoding and decoding. 
* [FOD] Fixed bugs during the creation of the index (PCRL progression order)
* [FOD] Fixed the maximum number of resolutions a user can discard while decoding.
		Added an error state in J2K_STATE (j2k.c)

November 14, 2007
! [FOD] - First Patch by Callum Lerwick. Instead of reinventing realloc, j2k_read_sod now just uses opj_realloc in j2k.c
		- Second Patch by Callum Lerwick. This patch rearranges the largest memory allocations so they're allocated as 
		late as possible, and freed as soon as possible. This cuts memory usage by about half on two large test images.
		- Third Patch by Callum Lerwick. The opj_tcd_cblk array is one of the largest allocations, because it
		contains a bunch of static buffers. This also makes it a major source of cache thrashing. This patch allocates 
		the buffers from the heap, and dynamically sizes them in the decoder. I have not yet managed to dynamically size 
		them in the encoder, getting the decoder to do it was tricky enough... I also split opj_tcd_cblk_t into separate 
		encode and decode versions. A lot of fields were not used by both, so this cuts its size even further.

* [FOD] Avoided ABI breakage

November 13, 2007
! [FOD] Patch by Dzonatas and Callum Lerwick.
        Fp/vectorization patch which basically converts most of the irreversible decode codepath to floating point,
        eliminating a few rounds of int/fp conversion, resulting in a vast performance improvement,
	and an increase in accuracy.

November 8, 2007
! [FOD] In t1.c, small change to avoid calling twice t1_getwmsedec()
        Patches from Callum Lewick:
		- Basic gcc optimization flags in cmake and makefile match.
		- Fixed some spelling errors in dwt.c.

November 5, 2007
*+ [GB] Fixed a bug which prevented JPWL from working on multi-tiled images; added some more fields in the interface info structures 
(keep a list of markers, save start packet number for each tile)

October 23, 2007
* [GB] Improved success for the linux build; OPJViewer shows all the COM contents
 
October 18, 2007
* [FOD] Changed the ROI parameter in the image_to_j2k codec to make it correspond to the documentation (i.e. -ROI c=0,U=25)
* [FOD] Patch from Callum Lewick. Memset patch. 
		The main idea of the patch is that currently opj_malloc clears all allocations, which unnecessarily
		dirties up the cache and eats bandwidth. This patch makes it no longer do so, and I've painstakingly determined which allocations actually need
		to be cleared and changed them to use opj_calloc() instead. I previously tried to just get rid of the opj_*alloc wrappers but that
		idea was nixed, so this time I'm trying it with macros. I also put in a gcc pragma that helps enforce their use. Which got messy.  :)  It caught a
		few places they weren't used but it also revealed that the mj2 tools are not very cleanly separated from the library. It includes all the
		internal headers, but it wasn't using the malloc wrappers. I figured the binaries should be "external" and have minimal knowledge of the
		internals of the library. I patched them to not include opj_includes.h, and include only the internal headers they actually need. However,
		they're using the opj_clock() function, which is in with the malloc wrappers. So I decided to move the malloc wrappers to their own header. 
		But mj2.c seems to want to be "internal", so I patched it to use the wrappers. Note that this patch changes the semantics of opj_malloc, it no longer
		clears the memory it allocates. If you need it to be cleared, you must use opj_calloc instead, or memset it yourself. It is also somewhat
		invasive, please test it extensively. I've been pounding on it all summer with my test suite, Second Life, and valgrind, and it checks out clean.

October 12, 2007
* [FOD] Changed the way the image structure is allocated when the decoding parameters include some resolutions to discard. 
        This should have a significant impact for the decoding of huge images when some resolutions are discarder (-r parameter)
        Warning: The output image size is now reduced when discarding resolutions !

October 10, 2007
* [FOD] Patch from Callum Lewick. Clean up of j2klib.h for the aligned malloc stuff. 
        It makes it work right with mingw, as _mm_malloc() isn't a macro, attempts to pave the way to using cmake 
        to check for this stuff and combines a patch from Dana Fagerstrom at Sun that makes it use memalign() on Solaris
        convert.c: Changed some error comments for TIFF images

September 27, 2007
* [FOD] Patch from Callum Lewick. Fixed dwt.c where an alignment in buffer was problematic under x86_64.

September 25, 2007
* [Mathieu Malaterre] BUG: Fix previous patch from Callum Lerwick. I have no
    clue what CMAKE_INSTALL_LIBDIR refers too. Bump up cmake 2.2 restriction to
    cmake 2.4 because of previous patch (not backward compatible). Properly set the SOVERSION in a cross plateform way (yes WIN32 is a platform)

September 19, 2007
* [Parvatha] Fixed issues with generation of SOP marker. 

September 18, 2007
* [Parvatha] Fixed issues with Reading and Writing TIF images in convert.c to avoid segmentation fault. 
* [Parvatha] Fixed issues relating to using user specified rates for CINEMA option for multiple images.

September 17, 2007
* [FOD] Fixed issues with cstr_info when codestream has components with different number of resolutions. 
! [FOD] OpenJPEG library interface modified to retain compatibility with version 1.2 

September 12, 2007
* [FOD] Patch from Callum Lerwick.
		Fixed the library linking so it links with the soversion properly set. 
		Fixes up the install targets so that it interacts properly with RPM. 
		Install target for MJ2. Sets some necessary and useful CFLAGS if gcc is in use.		
* [FOD] Updated the MJ2 codec to be compatible with the recent changes in the OpenJPEG library

September 11, 2007
* [GB] JPWL encoding is finalized correctly into the JP2 file format; added an additional structure in opj_codestream_info, to keep a record of the written markers

September 8, 2007
* [GB] Adapted the JPWL and OPJViewer code to new interface; fixed a samll bug in JPWL which created large EPBs even when null protection was specified

September 7, 2007
+ [FOD] Indexes can now be generated when decoding J2K codestreams.
* [Mathieu Malaterre] Upon failure, properly return error code (!=0).

September 6, 2007
+ [Mathieu Malaterre] CMake: start compiling mj2, jpwl and jp3d
+ [Mathieu Malaterre] CMake: output all executable/libs into one single directory
+ [Mathieu Malaterre] CMake: start compiling index_create
+ [Mathieu Malaterre] OpenJPEG.rc update copyright year
+ [Mathieu Malaterre] CMake: add Java j2kviewer but do not compile it using cmake since cmake has too poor support for Java. Should create a custom command running ant instead.
+ [Mathieu Malaterre] CMake: Add doxygen output
+ [GB] One more field in the codestream_info struct for recording the number of packets per tile part; JPWL now distributes the EPBs in all the tile part headers
+ [Mathieu Malaterre] CMake: Add very simple tests (simply run command line with no option)
* [Mathieu Malaterre] Fix unitialized read in img_fol (we may need a smarter initialize than memset)

September 4, 2007
+ [GB] Added some fields in the codestream_info structure: they are used to record the position of single tile parts. 
		Changed also the write_index function in the codec, to reflect the presence of this new information.

September 3, 2007
+ [GB] Added the knowledge of JPSEC SEC and INSEC markers (you have to compile the JPWL project). Management of these markers is limited to skipping them without crashing: 
		no real security function at this stage. Deprecated USE_JPSEC will be removed next

August 31, 2007
* [GB] Fixed save capabilities in OPJViewer due to recent code upgrade

August 30, 2007
* [FOD] Changed the OpenJPEG library interface to enable users to access information regarding the codestream (also called codestream index).
		This index is usefull for all applications requiring to have a scalable acces to the codestream (like JPIP applications, ...)
        Currently, this information is only available when encoding an image.       
+ [FOD] Added the information regarding the end of packet position in the index

July 13, 2007
! [FOD] Modified the memory allocation for codestreams containing multiple tiles. The memory is now allocated for each tile indenpendently, 
		leading to an important decrease of the virtual memory needed. [j2k.c tcd.h tcd.c]
! [FOD] Modified old comments about the ability to decode mega-images and comments about the disk size necessary to do this. [image_to_j2k.c and frames_to_mj2.c]

July 12, 2007
* [GB] fixed a bug in JPWL module, which prevented to exploit the full error correction capability of RS codes (e.g. it gave up at 5 errors, 
		even if 6 were correctable); defined a JPWL_MAXIMUM_EPB_ROOM for better customization of the maximum dimension of EPBs (the dimension 
		is pre-calculated on an hypothesis, if it goes beyond 65535 there will be problems, thus we give a little less than the max, let's say 65450)

July 8, 2007
* [ANTONIN] fixed the size of the memory allocation in cio.c (confusion between bits and bytes)

----------------------

May 4, 2007
* [FOD] Bugs corrected in decoding of command line (getopt.c), in the handling of 16 bit files (t1.c and tcd.c) and the calculation of elapsed time for multiple tiles parts (tcd.c and tdc.h).

June 2, 2007
+ [GB] OPJViewer opens now BMP, PNG, GIF, PNM, TIFF (with wxWidgets internals); added an encoder settings tab, for future integration with "save file as..." in JPEG 2000 format

May 31, 2007
* [FOD] Fixed the handling of 16bit TIFF files for cinema compression. Modified "convert.c"
* [FOD] Fixed the parameters used for cinema compression (9-7 transform used instead of 5-3). Modified "image_to_j2k.c"

May 24, 2007
* [FOD] Bug fixed by Sylvain Munaut. Change in the reading of the POC marker. Since COD/COC can be anywhere in the header, the decoder cannot always know while decoding the POC marker 
		the value of numlayers and numresolution.

May 23, 2007
! [FOD] Patch suggested by Callum Lerwick <seg@haxxed.com>: "This makes the t1 data arrays dynamic, which greatly reduces cache thrashing. Also, some minor cleanup to prevent unnecessary casts"

May 22, 2007
! [FOD] Patch suggested by Callum Lerwick <seg@haxxed.com>: "Some formatting cleanups, 
		so that the long function definitions and calls fit on screen. Use of prefix increment which is theoretically faster, in practice any sane compiler can optimize a postfix 
		increment but its best not to count on such things. Consolidation of some redundant calculations in the inner loops, which becomes very useful in the future autovectorize patch."
! [FOD] Patch suggested by Callum Lerwick <seg@haxxed.com>: "This changes the flag code in t1 to use a flag_t type, which can then be changed to reduce RAM usage. It is now typedef to a short."
! [FOD] Patch suggested by Callum Lerwick <seg@haxxed.com>: "This patch makes the t1 LUTs static. I actually intend this as a prelude to possibly eliminating some or all of the LUTs entirely."

May 11, 2007
- [FOD]	JP3D library Binaries removed from SVN.
! [FOD] MJ2 codec updated from LibOpenJPEG version 0.97 to LibOpenJPEG version 1. Hence, the MJ2 codec will now take advantage of all the improvements and optimizations done on the LibOpenJPEG library.
