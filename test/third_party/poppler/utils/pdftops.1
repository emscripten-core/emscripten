.SH NAME
pdftops \- Portable Document Format (PDF) to PostScript converter
(version 3.00)
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B pdftops
[options]
.RI <PDF-file>
.RI [<PS-file>]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B Pdftops
converts Portable Document Format (PDF) files to PostScript so they
can be printed.
.PP
Pdftops reads the PDF file,
.IR PDF-file ,
and writes a PostScript file,
.IR PS-file .
If
.I PS-file
is not specified, pdftops converts
.I file.pdf
to
.I file.ps
(or
.I file.eps
with the \-eps option).  If
.I PS-file
is \'-', the PostScript is sent to stdout.
.SH OPTIONS
.TP
.BI \-f " number"
Specifies the first page to print.
.TP
.BI \-l " number"
Specifies the last page to print.
.TP
.B \-level1
Generate Level 1 PostScript.  The resulting PostScript files will be
significantly larger (if they contain images), but will print on Level
1 printers.  This also converts all images to black and white.  No
more than one of the PostScript level options (\-level1, \-level1sep,
\-level2, \-level2sep, \-level3, \-level3Sep) may be given.
.TP
.B \-level1sep
Generate Level 1 separable PostScript.  All colors are converted to
CMYK.  Images are written with separate stream data for the four
components.
.TP
.B \-level2
Generate Level 2 PostScript.  Level 2 supports color images and image
compression.  This is the default setting.
.TP
.B \-level2sep
Generate Level 2 separable PostScript.  All colors are converted to
CMYK.  The PostScript separation convention operators are used to
handle custom (spot) colors.
.TP
.B \-level3
Generate Level 3 PostScript.  This enables all Level 2 features plus
CID font embedding.
.TP
.B \-level3Sep
Generate Level 3 separable PostScript.  The separation handling is the
same as for \-level2Sep.
.TP
.B \-origpagesizes
Generate a PostScript file with variable page sizes and orientations,
taking for each page the size of the original page in the PDF file. 
The PostScript file contains "<</PageSize [WIDTH HEIGHT]>> setpagedevice"
lines in each page header, so that the paper input tray gets correctly
changed on the printer. This option should be used when pdftops is used
as a print filter. Any specification of the page size via \-paper,
\-paperw, or \-paperh will get overridden as long as each page of the
PDF file has a defined paper size.  No more than one of the mode options
(\-origpagesizes, \-eps, \-form) may be given.
.TP
.B \-eps
Generate an Encapsulated PostScript (EPS) file.  An EPS file contains
a single image, so if you use this option with a multi-page PDF file,
you must use \-f and \-l to specify a single page.  No more than one of
the mode options (\-origpagesizes, \-eps, \-form) may be given.
.TP
.B \-form
Generate a PostScript form which can be imported by software that
understands forms.  A form contains a single page, so if you use this
option with a multi-page PDF file, you must use \-f and \-l to specify a
single page.  The \-level1 option cannot be used with \-form.  No more
than one of the mode options (\-origpagesizes, \-eps, \-form) may be
given.
.TP
.B \-opi
Generate OPI comments for all images and forms which have OPI
information.  (This option is only available if pdftops was compiled
with OPI support.)
.TP
.B \-noembt1
By default, any Type 1 fonts which are embedded in the PDF file are
copied into the PostScript file.  This option causes pdftops to
substitute base fonts instead.  Embedded fonts make PostScript files
larger, but may be necessary for readable output.
.TP
.B \-noembtt
By default, any TrueType fonts which are embedded in the PDF file are
copied into the PostScript file.  This option causes pdftops to
substitute base fonts instead.  Embedded fonts make PostScript files
larger, but may be necessary for readable output.  Also, some
PostScript interpreters do not have TrueType rasterizers.
.TP
.B \-noembcidps
By default, any CID PostScript fonts which are embedded in the PDF
file are copied into the PostScript file.  This option disables that
embedding.  No attempt is made to substitute for non-embedded CID
PostScript fonts.
.TP
.B \-noembcidtt
By default, any CID TrueType fonts which are embedded in the PDF file
are copied into the PostScript file.  This option disables that
embedding.  No attempt is made to substitute for non-embedded CID
TrueType fonts.
.TP
.B \-passfonts
By default, references to non-embedded 8-bit fonts in the PDF file are
substituted with the closest "Helvetica", "Times-Roman", or "Courier" font.
This option passes references to non-embedded fonts
through to the PostScript file.
.TP
.B \-preload
preload images and forms
.TP
.BI \-paper " size"
Set the paper size to one of "letter", "legal", "A4", or "A3".  This
can also be set to "match", which will set the paper size to match the
size specified in the PDF file. \-origpagesizes overrides this setting
if the PDF file has defined page sizes.
.TP
.BI \-paperw " size"
Set the paper width, in points. \-origpagesizes overrides this setting
if the PDF file has defined page sizes.
.TP
.BI \-paperh " size"
Set the paper height, in points. \-origpagesizes overrides this setting
if the PDF file has defined page sizes.
.TP
.B \-nocrop
By default, output is cropped to the CropBox specified in the PDF
file.  This option disables cropping.
.TP
.B \-expand
Expand PDF pages smaller than the paper to fill the paper.  By
default, these pages are not scaled.
.TP
.B \-noshrink
Don't scale PDF pages which are larger than the paper.  By default,
pages larger than the paper are shrunk to fit.
.TP
.B \-nocenter
By default, PDF pages smaller than the paper (after any scaling) are
centered on the paper.  This option causes them to be aligned to the
lower-left corner of the paper instead.
.TP
.B \-duplex
Set the Duplex pagedevice entry in the PostScript file.  This tells
duplex-capable printers to enable duplexing.
.TP
.BI \-opw " password"
Specify the owner password for the PDF file.  Providing this will
bypass all security restrictions.
.TP
.BI \-upw " password"
Specify the user password for the PDF file.
.TP
.B \-q
Don't print any messages or errors.
.TP
.B \-v
Print copyright and version information.
.TP
.B \-h
Print usage information.
.RB ( \-help
and
.B \-\-help
are equivalent.)
