OpenGL ES 2.0 Programming Guide - Example code for Linux/X11 environment

Adaptation code for Linux/X11 environment for the examples of the book
OpenGL ES 2.0 Programming Guide written by Jarkko Vatjus-Anttila. All
original example code has remained unmodified. Adaptation changes are
in esUtil.c|h files, which encapsulates all X11 specific internals from
the application layer.

Prerequisites for building the source is a valid GCC toolchain (4.5.2
4.6.1 are tested) and properly setup X11 & GLESv2 & EGL environment.
Mesa project offers such setup, and version 7.11 has been tested with
software rendering. Also native GLESv2 renderer has been tested using
NVidia Tegra2 setup. More details about the tested environments are
below:

The code has been tested with three configurations
- ATI Radeon HD 3200 graphics with Mesa 7.11-0ubuntu3, Ubuntu 11.10
- NVidia Quadro FX 2800M/PCI/SSE2 with Mesa 7.11-0ubuntu3, Ubuntu 11.10
- NVidia Tegra 2, native EGL/GLESv2 drivers, Ubuntu 10.10

Native GLESv2 on Tegra2 renders all the test cases correctly. However,
Mesa 7.11 has problems with the Chapter 13 particle test, which at least
with the mentioned test setups create only a black screen.

Compiling the examples should be as easy as running "make" in the root
linux directory.
