The files in this directory contain the code of the ALUT library. They typically
compile to make 'libalut.so' on *nix platforms or to 'alut.dll' for Windows
platforms.

There is also a header file 'alut.h' in ../include/AL which gets installed into
$(includedir)/AL/alut.h on *nix platforms and someplace else entirely on
Windows platforms.

The file 'helloworld.wav' is the original voice recording of Steve Baker saying
this immortal phrase. It is converted into a large hexadecimal data block inside
alutWaveform.c - but this file is retained in version control just in case
anyone ever feels like re-doing it. The format is 16bit PCM, 1 channel, 44.1kHz
sample rate.
