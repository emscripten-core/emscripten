ALUT Test Suite
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

These programs are not intended to be particularly excellent
programming style (some of them are downright terrible!) - but
they do provide a reasonable way to test out that ALUT is working
correctly.

test_version     : Tests that the ALUT header file version agrees with
                   the ALUT library version.

test_waveforms   : Plays a second of 440Hz audio using a variety of waveforms
                   in order to exercise the ALUT sound synthesis routines.

test_errorstuff  : Tries to load a non-existant file in order to test ALUT's
                   error handler.

test_fileloader  : Loads three files (in different formats) using ALUT's
                   'standard' file loader.

test_memoryloader: Loads a WAV file into memory - then uses ALUT's
                   'File Image' loader.

test_retrostuff  : Loads a WAV file using the two old-fashioned methods from
                   ALUT 0.x.x

If compiling these programs produces lots of errors, then you've probably
got an old ALUT header file lying around somewhere.  If that's the case
then the 'test_version' program should at least have compiled.  You
can run it to verify the version numbers of both header and ALUT library
binary.
