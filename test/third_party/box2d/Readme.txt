Please see Building.txt to learn how to build Box2D and run the testbed.

To run the demos, set "Testbed" as your startup project and press F5. Some test bed commands are:
- 'r' to reset the current test
- SPACE to launch a bomb
- arrow keys to pan
- 'x' and 'z' to zoom in/out
- use the mouse to click and drag objects
