/*
 * This file is necessary for the *nix version of "freeglut" because the
 * original GLUT defined its font variables in rather an unusual way.
 * Publicly, in "glut.h", they were defined as "void *".  Privately,
 * in one of the source code files, they were defined as pointers to a
 * structure.  Most compilers and linkers are satisfied with the "void *"
 * and don't go any farther, but some of them balked.  In particular,
 * when compiling with "freeglut" and then trying to run using the GLUT
 * ".so" library, some of them would give an error.  So we are having to
 * create this file to define the variables as pointers to an unusual
 * structure to match GLUT.
 */

/*
 * freeglut_internal.h uses some GL types, but including the GL header portably
 * is a bit tricky, so we include freeglut_std.h here, which contains the
 * necessary machinery. But this poses another problem, caused by the ugly
 * original defintion of the font constants in "classic" GLUT: They are defined
 * as void* externally, so we move them temporarily out of the way by AN EXTREME
 * CPP HACK.
