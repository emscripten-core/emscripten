@section Q1 Is ENet thread safe?

ENet does not use any significant global variables, the vast majority
of state is encapsulated in the ENetHost structure.  As such, as long
as the application guards access to this structure, then ENet should
operate fine in a multithreaded environment.
   
@section Q2 Isn't ENet just re-inventing TCP?!  What's the point?

In a perfect world, that would be true.  But as many have found, using
TCP either in lieu of or in conjunction with UDP can lead to all kinds
of nightmares.  TCP is a good, solid protocol, however it simply isn't
up to the task of real-time games.  Too much of TCP's implementation
dictates a policy that isn't practical for games.  If you want to use
TCP, then do so -- this library is for people that either don't want
to use TCP or have tried and ended up being discouraged with the
performance.
