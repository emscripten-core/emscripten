ENet's purpose is to provide a relatively thin, simple and robust
network communication layer on top of UDP (User Datagram Protocol).
The primary feature it provides is optional reliable, in-order
delivery of packets.

ENet omits certain higher level networking features such as authentication, 
lobbying, server discovery, encryption, or other similar tasks that are
particularly application specific so that the library remains flexible,
portable, and easily embeddable.

/**
@page SourceDistro Source Distribution

You can retrieve the source to ENet by downloading it in either .tar.gz form
or accessing the cvs distribution directly.

The most recent stable release (1.3.3) can be downloaded <a href="http://enet.bespin.org/download/enet-1.3.3.tar.gz">here</a>. 
The last release that is protocol compatible with the 1.2 series or earlier (1.2.5) can be downloaded <a href="http://enet.bespin.org/download/enet-1.2.5.tar.gz">here</a> 

To access ENet via anonymous CVS, you must use the CVSROOT
:pserver:anonymous\@bespin.org:/var/lib/cvs/enet with an empty
password.

@code
	$ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@bespin.org:/var/lib/cvs/enet login
@endcode
	Hit the return key when prompted for a password.
@code
	$ cvs -z3 -d :pserver:anonymous@bespin.org:/var/lib/cvs/enet co -l .
	$ cvs -z3 co enet
@endcode

This will create a CVS directory in the current directory, and with
the second command will proceed to check the enet module out of CVS.
Any problems with CVS access or request for write access should be
sent via email to @ref MailingList.
