	- Fixed quantization problem for planar triangle meshes in btOptimizedBvh
		Thanks Phil Knight for reporting and helping to fix this bug.
		
2007 May 20
	- btAxisSweep3: Fixed a bug in btAxisSweep3 (sweep and prune) related to object removal. Only showed up when at least one btStaticPlaneShape was inserted.
		Thanks tbp for more details on reproducing case.
	- btAxisSweep3: Fixed issue with full 32bit precision btAxisSweep3 (define BP_USE_FIXEDPOINT_INT_32), it used only 0xffff/65536 for quantization instead of full integer space (0xffffffff)
	- btRaycastVehicle: Added 'getForwardVector' and getCurrentSpeedKmHour utility functions
	- Fixed local scaling issues (btConvexTriangleMeshShape, btBvhTriangleMeshShape, removed scaling from btMatrix3x3).

2007 March 20
	- Added refit tree to quantized stackless tree, and updated ConcaveDemo as example.
	
2007 March 17
	- Added constraint solver optimizations, avoiding cross products during iterations, and gather rigidbody/constraint info in contiguous memory (btSolverBody/btSolverConstraint)
	- These optimizations don't give large benefit yet, but it has good potential. Turned on by default. Can be switched off using solver->setSolverMode(SOLVER_RANDMIZE_ORDER).
	- Enabled anti-jitter for rigid bodies. This is experimental, and can be switched off by setting a global (it is experimental so no proper interface) gJitterVelocityDampingFactor = 1.0;
	- Fixed bug in islandmanifold.heapSort(btPersistentManifoldSortPredicate()); , thanks Noehrgel for reporting this (affected Sun Solaris)
	
2007 March 12
	- Added compile-time toggle between on 16-bit and 32-bit fixed-point SAP broadphase.

	- Enable useQuantizedAabbCompression on btTriangleMesh, see ColladaDemo
	
2007 March 8
	- Fixed bug in constraint/island sorting (caused by replacing STL by dedicated btAlignedObjectArray with heapSort)
		Thanks Clemens Unterkofler for pointing this out!

2007 March 6
	- removed STL from the Bullet library: replace std::vector by btAlignedObjectArray. Also removed the std::set for overlapping pair set, and turned it into an overlapping pair array. The SAP only adds objects, never removed. Removal is postponed for during traversal of overlapping pairs (duplicates and non-overlapping pairs are removed during that traversal).
	- added heap sort and binary search/linear search to btAlignedObjectArray
	- fixed wrong cast, thanks Hamstray, http://www.continuousphysics.com/Bullet/phpBB2/viewtopic.php?t=1015


2007 Feb 25
	- Improved performance of convex collision shapes, cache local AABB instead of recomputation. This fixes issue with very slow performance in larger .bsp levels
	
2007 Feb 24
	- Added compressed/quantized AABB tree, 16 bytes per node, while supporting 32-bit (triangle) indices. 
	  Should be faster and smaller then original version (quantized aabb check is done in integer space)
		Original aabb tree nodes are still supported. They are 44 bytes, with full floating point precision and additional subPart index.
	- added meter-unit scaling support in ColladaConverter.cpp

2007 Feb 21
	- Build system: updated bullet.pc.in library names
	- Updated EPA comparison integration (missing parameter)
	
2007 Jan 04
	- fixed optimized AABB tree building: in some cases the tree building fails due to unbalanced trees, which generated stack overflow
	
2006 Dec 15
	- added contribution to allow double precision collision detection/dynamics. Define BT_USE_DOUBLE_PRECISION in your project and libraries that include Bullet

2006 Dec 14
	- merged contact and non-contact constraint solving into one loop, will improve stability of jointed bodies during collisions
	- added first draft for hingeConstraint motor
	
2006 Dec 8, Erwin Coumans
	- preparation for SIMD: added btAlignedAllocator and btAlignedObjectArray, to replace stl std::vector, same interface, but compatible with 16 byte alignment
	- cleaned up dependencies in autogenerated msvc projectfiles
	- aligned btVector3 on 16 bytes boundary, under win32. see if developers will come up with problems

2006 Dec 04, Erwin Coumans
	Added btNearCallback. This is similar to Open Dynamics Engine (ODE) dNearCallback, but important differences:
	- contact points are persistent (lifetime more then one frame, for warmstarting/incremental contact point management)
	- continuous collision detection, time of impact
	Added btRigidBody::isInWorld(), returns true if btRigidBody is inside a btCollisionWorld/btDynamicsWorld derived class
	Added angularFactor to btRigidbody, this helps some character control (no angular impulse applied)

	Fixed kinematic support (deriving velocities for animated objects)
	Updated comparison/optional quickstep solver in Extras
	UserCollisionAlgorithm demonstrates btTriangleMesh usage (easier trimesh compared to index array version)
