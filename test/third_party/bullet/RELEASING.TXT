This document details the steps necessary to package a release of Bullet.

1) Preparing for release:

update VERSION in several places
update ChangeLog 
regenerate MSVC project files

2) Generating the release .zip:
Do an SVN export on a Windows machine into the directory: bullet-X.YY
prepare a zip file containing the directory

3) Generating the release .tar.gz:
Do an SVN export on a Unix machine into the directory: bullet-X.YY
prepare a .tar.gz file containing the directory

4) Uploading release to google code:

Google Code Bullet downloads URL: http://code.google.com/p/bullet/downloads/list

Title of release should follow this guide line: Bullet <VERSION> Physics SDK <Release Type> (revision)

It is better to upload the .tar.gz before the .zip so that the .zip appears first in the list

If the release is an Alpha/Beta or RC the tags should be: Type-Source, OpSys-ALL
If the release is a final release the tags should be: Type-Source, OpSys-ALL, Featured

5) Obsoleting old releases

Edit the tags on old releases and add the 'Deprecated' tag
