** Windows Compilation **

	Open the Microsoft Visual Studio solution in msvc/20xx/BULLET_PHYSICS.sln

Alternatively, use CMake to autogenerate a build system for Windows:
	
	- Download/install CMake from www.cmake.org or package manager
	- Use cmake-gui or
	- List available build systems by running 'cmake' in the Bullet root folder
	- Use cmake-gui 
	- Create a build system using the -G option for example:
	
	cmake . -G "Visual Studio 9 2008" or
	cmake . -G "Visual Studio 9 2008 Win64"


** Linux Compilation **

  - Download/install CMake from www.cmake.org or package manager
    CMake is like autoconf in that it will create build scripts which are then 
    used for the actual compilation

	- List available build systems by running 'cmake' in the Bullet root folder
	- Create a build system using the -G option for example:

	cmake . -G "Unix Makefiles"

  - There are some options for cmake builds:
      BUILD_SHARED_LIBS: default 'OFF', set to 'ON' to build .so libraries
      BUILD_EXTRAS: default 'ON', compiles additional libraries in 'Extras'
      BUILD_DEMOS: default 'ON', compiles applications found in 'Demos'
      CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: default '/usr/local', the installation path.
      CMAKE_INSTALL_RPATH: if you install outside a standard ld search path,
        then you should set this to the installation lib path.
      CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: default 'Release', can include debug symbols with
        either 'Debug' or 'RelWithDebInfo'.
    Other options may be discovered by 'cmake --help-variable-list' and
    'cmake --help-variable OPTION'

  - Run 'cmake' with desired options of the form -DOPTION=VALUE
    By default this will create the usual Makefile build system, but CMake can 
    also produce Eclipse or KDevelop project files.  See 'cmake --help' to see 
    what "generators" are available in your environment, selected via '-G'.
        For example:
        cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebugInfo

  - Assuming using the default Makefile output from cmake, run 'make' to 
    build, and then 'make install' if you wish to install.


** Mac OS X Compilation **

  - Download/install CMake from www.cmake.org or package manager
    CMake is like autoconf in that it will create build scripts which are then 
    used for the actual compilation

	- List available build systems by running 'cmake' in the Bullet root folder
	- Create a build system using the -G option for example:

  cmake . -G Xcode
  cmake . -G "Unix Makefiles"

  - There are some options for cmake builds:
      BUILD_SHARED_LIBS: default 'OFF', set to 'ON' to build .dylib libraries
      BUILD_EXTRAS: default 'ON', compiles additional libraries in 'Extras'
      BUILD_DEMOS: default 'ON', compiles applications found in 'Demos'
      CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX: default '/usr/local', the installation path.
      CMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR: if you install outside a standard ld search 
        path, then you should set this to the installation lib/framework path. 
      CMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES: defaults to the native architecture, but can be
        set to a semicolon separated list for fat binaries, e.g. ppc;i386;x86_64
      CMAKE_BUILD_TYPE: default 'Release', can include debug symbols with
        either 'Debug' or 'RelWithDebInfo'.

    To build framework bundles:
      FRAMEWORK: default 'OFF', also requires 'BUILD_SHARED_LIBS' set ON
        If both FRAMEWORK and BUILD_SHARED_LIBS are set, will create
        OS X style Framework Bundles which can be placed in 
        linked via the -framework gcc argument or drag into Xcode projects.
    (If not framework, then UNIX style 'include' and 'lib' will be produced)
      
    Other options may be discovered by 'cmake --help-variable-list' and
    'cmake --help-variable OPTION'

  - Run 'cmake' with desired options of the form -DOPTION=VALUE
    By default this will create the usual Makefile build system, but CMake can 
    also produce Eclipse or KDevelop project files.  See 'cmake --help' to see 
    what "generators" are available in your environment, selected via '-G'.
        For example:
        cmake -DBUILD_SHARED_LIBS=ON -DFRAMEWORK=ON \
              -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/Library/Frameworks \
              -DCMAKE_INSTALL_NAME_DIR=/Library/Frameworks \
              -DCMAKE_OSX_ARCHITECTURES='ppc;i386;x86_64' \
              -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=RelWithDebugInfo

  - Assuming using the default Makefile output from cmake, run 'make' to build 
    and then 'make install'.


** Alternative Mac OS X and Linux via autoconf/make **
  - at the command line:
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make
