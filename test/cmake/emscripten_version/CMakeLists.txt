# A particular gotcha about Emscripten version testing: do not use the following
# code:

#    if (${EMSCRIPTEN_VERSION} VERSION_GREATER "1.38.5")

# because this would fail when running on an Emscripten version older than
# 1.38.6. That is, note the needed double quotes around ${EMSCRIPTEN_VERSION}.
# This is because in older Emscripten versions, the EMSCRIPTEN_VERSION CMake
# variable did not yet exist, so the above if statement would expand to an empty
# left hand side: if ( VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL 1.38.6) which would be a syntax
# error. if ("" VERSION_GREATER_EQUAL 1.38.6) is fine however.
