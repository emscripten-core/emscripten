Async waiting on address with unexpected value should return 'not-equal'
Waiting on address with unexpected value should return 'not-equal' also if timeout==0
Waiting for 0 milliseconds should return 'timed-out'
Waiting for >0 milliseconds should return 'ok' (but successfully time out in first call to asyncWaitFinished)
Waiting for infinitely long should return 'ok' (and return 'ok' in second call to asyncWaitFinished)
