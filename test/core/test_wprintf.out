PrintBigWide wrote 426 wchars:
test string has 425 wide characters.
Internally the variadic print functions use a 256 char buffer, so this is a string that's longer than 256 chars, so in case this breaks we have a test case. As discovered in #9305 vswprintf had been broken for some time, but was never picked up as the test strings were all shorter then 256 chars. So hopefully this long rambly string will help guard against that bug being re-introduced.

The half of 80 is 40, and the half of that is 20.
