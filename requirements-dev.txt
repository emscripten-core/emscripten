# TODO(sbc): switch to using Pipenv since it seems like that way to go
# these day managing python deps.
# These requirements are only needed for developers who want to run ruff on
# the codebase and generate docs using Sphinx, not for users of emscripten.
# Install with `pip3 install -r requirements-dev.txt`
